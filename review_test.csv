The experience was abysmal:Day 2 test - sample posted on a Friday morning (at 7am in a priority postbox) - Results received following Tuesday morning, e.g. day 7 of quarantine. Day 5 test-to-release test - sample posted Sunday morning, admittedly not picked up by Royal Mail until Monday morning, but even so results received on the following Saturday, e.g. would be day 11 of quarantine - which means he effectively paid to be released from quarantine early for nothing.Day 8 test - sample posted on Wednesday afternoon - Results received on the following Monday, e.g. would be day 13 of quarantine.The company blatantly admits that they do not process any samples at the weekend, so I have to ask - why sell a service that effectively is required 7/7 ? No customer service or aftercare.Whatsapp messages ignored. Overpriced tests.Results take 5 days. No service at the weekends.\n            ', ""\n                Avoid this company. Day 2 results arrived more than 48 hours after they received the test even though they say you'll get the results within 24 hours of receiving the test. I still haven't received my day 8 test result and I'm on day 12 of quarantine now. I sent the test on day 8, they received it on day 9 in the morning and still no result. The worst thing is that you can only contact them on WhatsApp and they haven't even responded to my text messages. The phone on their website does not exist and they haven't replied to my email either. Avoid at all costs!\n            "", '\n                DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They are scammers.

Then even though you have filled out the passenger locator form, which forces you to select one of these companies, they already have your details. But this company wants your details privately. All employees are Muslims who do NOT even work in a laboratory.

First, the day 2 test wasn't conducted until two days after they received it, and the results only came in once we threatened them with an inquiry by a government ombudsman. Then, with the day 5 test, they confirmed receiving it on a Monday but only sent out the results that Friday. Even worse, the certificate was marked as the sample having been received on the Wednesday. So, not only did they either lie about receiving the test sample or not have it at all, they then went on to forge the actual document that would allow test to release, and that only arrived nearly a week after the covid test was taken. Avoid like the plague they are. The irony of the statement hasn't escaped me.

Although the page where I bought the tests says they give 24 hour results, on their website's homepage they say results received after 2pm are counted as received the next business day. I checked the tracking and they received our samples just after 2pm on Day 3, so I assume they counted it as received in the morning of Day 4. I am now in the afternoon of Day 5 and still no result. Don't use this service if you want to get out of quarantine quickly.We rebooked our Day 5 test with a provider that gives same day results.

First of all, my kits arrived two days late. I sent in my Day 2 test as soon as I received it, but after five days I still never received results. I tried to get in touch with the company but they essentially ignored my WhatsApp messaged. They did, however, respond to a separate email simply telling me that the package never arrived. They\'re the ones who set up the package and presumably have the tracking info, but no more details were provided. Beyond these perfunctory responses they were not helpful whatsoever. When Day 8 came around I wondered if I should even send in my second test ... after all, what was the point? I\'m fully vaccinated and hadn\'t even been contacted by the NHS since arriving. This whole thing felt like a disorganized money grab. So I didn\'t send in the Day 8. And guess what: nothing happened. I found a place I could walk into to get a same day rapid PCR in order to fly out of the country. That worked fine. If you look into this company it\'s clear that it\'s a shady operation. Its ""office address"" is actually a front created by one of those shell companies you pay to set up a pseudo business address when you don\'t have a real office. It was also only incorporated a couple months ago, which is a bit of a red flag. I couldn\'t find any information on the person who apparently owns the company: Mr Nabil Sodfi. But the whole enterprise just seems sketchy. At best this is just a poorly run government-sanctioned grift.

Everything else was fine.\n            ', ""\n                The only good thing I can say about this company, is that it does not take them too long to reply to your emails. Well, it also depends on what the email is about. I paid £190 for day 2, 5 (early release) and 8 tests. As soon as I ordered the tests, I got worried that I had been scammed, as I didn't get any confirmation email or receipt. I went on their website just to find an email and a WhatsApp number that says 'message only', which did not seem too professional to me at all. To give them some credit, they did reply quite fast, and sent me the confirmation with the Royal Mail tracking no. On their website, the company also promises that you get the results within 24 hours. In my case, on day 5 of my quarantine (Wednesday, late evening), I received the results for the test I had sent on day 3 (Monday, morning). This is more than 48 hours! Then, when I had concerns in regard to my early release day 5 test results  (I paid £60 for this one, as I had reasons to leave the house as soon as I could), I was told that the day 5 tests were prioritised and that I was going to get them as soon as possible. To put it in perspective, I sent my test on day 5 (Wednesday) early in the day, because it was 10am. When I contacted them the following day (Thursday), I was told that the tests hadn't arrived at the lab yet. Now I'm on day 7 of my quarantine, no email has come through and it seems like the company has been struggling to reply to all my previous emails, ever since I asked for a refund for (at least) my day 5 tests. I'll be leaving the quarantine in 3 days, so it really doesn't make sense for me to pay this amount of money for the test that doesn't do it's job. The issue here is that there is no law protecting the customers should they receive their test results later than they were meant to. And on top of that, there are so many people getting the tests, that you are not a customer the company needs to keep in order to survive. So basically, as soon as you pay, you're fu*ked.\n            "", '\n                Do not use. After paying almost £200 for test and release the tests did not arrive.

Rest assured that we listen to all feedback given so that we can provide a better service in the future.I have checked your account and can see that your Day 2 results are now ready. Your Day 8 sample was received by the lab on 8/8/2021 11:45:07 AM, meaning that you can expect to receive the results within 48 hours!If you are having difficulty navigating your online account, please contact our friendly Customer Service team for more help.You can also visit our FAQs page for further information.Kind regards,RickAND THIS IS MY REPLYThe response is factually incorrect on two counts:1) Our day 8 samples were delivered by Royal Mail on 07 August 2021 at 07:38, 08:04 and 08:05 respectively. I have tracking numbers proving this. They were not delivered on 08 August at 11:45 as stated. If it takes 27 hours to get from the postroom to the lab, then clearly there are some internal logistical issues. Which brings me to turnaround times:2) The advertised turnaround time, on the 0044 Covid Test website, is as follows (direct quote from the website):""Your results will be available online within 24 hours from the date the sample reaches the lab.""So not 48 hours as advised in the reply. We should have received them this morning. And if it takes 27 hours to reach the lab from the postroom, there isn\'t a chance in hell of meeting the advertised 24 hour turnaround time.I will let readers of this review make their own opinion of Rightangled, trading as 0044 Covid Test, and whether to use them in light of our experience and their response. I certainly won\'t in future.EDIT 25/AUG/2021: This company now trades under +44 COVID Test on the government approved list of covid test providers.\n            ', '\n                I have used this service for a group of 8 family members arriving to U.K. on 1st August from an amber list country.I’m quarantining with family in a privately rented place.

According to the tracking the kits were received on our day 3 before 9 am but it’s end of our day 4 and the website and company is denying that the lab has received our test kits!!!Looking at the reviews it seems this is a very inefficient company who is not keeping up to their word. I’m truly worried that they will deny knowledge of receiving our day 8 kits as well and delay the quarantine period which is unacceptable They must be reported to relevant authorities and please consider legal action as a group\n            ', '\n                I have also reviewed rightangled.co as that\'s the actual provider of these test kits - 0044covidtest was the company that sold them to me when I picked them at random from the government webpage. Please let this be a warning to others not to do the same!I ordered my kit 10 days ahead of travel and that was fine - kits were delivered as promised.However, I am now on day 7 of quarantine and have had no results whatsoever. I posted my Day 2 kit on time and, fair enough, it was the weekend so Royal Mail tracked it as \'delivered\' on the morning of Day 5. That was 48 hours ago, and rightangled\'s web portal is still displaying ""awaiting return to lab"". My Day 5 \'test to release\' kit was delivered 24 hours ago and has the same status, so I\'m pessimistic about actually being released early at all.Since booking this kit, I read more about some of the other ones available. Choices are more limited outside of London, but I found at least one company that conducts \'at home\' test kits that you can process yourself via a Zoom call, thereby getting almost instant results. I would 100% book this in future - that way you could actually end your quarantine on Day 5 rather than getting your hopes up and still having to do all 10 days anyway!EDIT TO ADD: 36 hours after receiving Day 5 kit, and coincidentally at the exact same time as disputing this review, I was issued a \'test to release\' certificate. This is within the 24-48 hour promise, and I\'m delighted to be able to end my quarantine.

Royal Mail\'s tracking service indicated that it arrived at it\'s destination on the morning of day 7.Bizarrely Rightangled\'s website didn\'t show the same information. It still said to the effect of ""waiting for delivery of sample"" on it\'s website\'s tracker.I emailed Rightangled to ask why Royal Mail had said they had delivered it but they hadn\'t acknowledged it on their end and they said ""Royal Mail takes up to 3 days to reach our labs."" which actually avoided answering my question as Royal Mail have already told me they delivered it in 24 hours using ""Royal Mail 24"".One of their service reps told me that I shouldn\'t have used Royal Mail 24 even though they included it with the pack and offered no warning that it might cause a delay. This is all nonsense though as we already know that Royal Mail delivered it in 24 hours and have confirmed this.They then told me that when the lab recives the sample that it will take up to two days to get a result.So in their own words, for a day 5 test to release pack: It takes up to 3 days to recieve the sample (apparently even if Royal Mail say they delivered it sooner) and then a further 2 days to get a result. Meaning you\'ll probably get a result on day 10 rendering the whole test to release scheme totally pointless.They still continue to sell these test packs on their website in spite of this obvious issue and it is stated that no refunds available for covid 19 testing.I finally received my result today (Day 12) far later than would have been useful. Afrer repeatedly pointing out my rights as per the 2015 Consumer Rights Act they eventually somewhat relented and refunded me for the cost of the tests (£60) but not the cost of delivery (£35) for this ""service"" which was pointlelssly petty considering everything they had put me though.I sent my day 8 test to a different provider named Biograd Diagnostics at 2pm on day 8 and recieved my result at 7:35pm the very next day. The postal service used?... Royal Mail 24.I read a lot of the reviews on here and assumed that only people who complained left reviews so I just dismissed them. That was my mistake.I would strongly recommend avoiding Rightangled and 0044CovidTest when it comes to doing covid testing. They are not capable of providing the service and should be removed from the government\'s list of providers in my view.\n            ', '\n                Shoddy resellers of a poor service.Don\'t get a day 5 test for ""Early release"".If Day 5 is a Monday, they might get it on a Tuesday, the delay is 48-72 hours(if you\'re lucky) so that\'s Friday - Day 9.  If there\'s a weekend involved, you\'ll get it on Day 11.  After your release.And yes, this is exactly my experience.\n            ', ""\n                Absolutely appalling! I was charged £35.45 for shipping. I could have sent a pallet for that much money. The kit only arrived 3 days after ordering, beside paying that much. I tested and posted straight away and I still haven't got a result for day 2 (at day 8). Lucky I haven't picked their test to release kit.

We had no problem undertaking the tests after our trip - instructions were very clear.  I made a mistake registering my test so i called the customer service team who quickly helped resolve the issue.  We sent our tests off via Royal Mail using the prepaid envelopes provided on a Tuesday and got the results on the Friday - so exactly as promised.  My only criticism is that there is no way to register a child's test within a parent's account.  You have to create a separate account for each person, for which you need an email address.

As for my son\'s, we\'re still waiting on day 10.We also sent our day 8 tests two days ago. Royal Mail delivered them yesterday at 08:05. Rightangled haven\'t turned these tests around within the advertised 24 hour period - in fact, their online portal still advises that they haven\'t received them!This is particularly frustrating, as we purchased day 5 test to release with another company at significant cost. That company got us our results within 24 hours - but we couldn\'t exit isolation because none of our day 2 tests were back!We went with 0044 Covid Test / Rightangled because they were on the government approved list, and were generally cheaper than other providers. Well I guess you get what you pay for - go ""cheap"", get poor service. I have since found out that the company has previously allegedly been reprimanded by the regulator UKAS, and accused of defrauding New Yorkers by the State\'s Attorney General, as reported by The Times in May 2020.Not fit for purpose, avoid at all costs.THIS IS THE REPLY FROM RIGHTANGLED, 0044 COVID TEST\'S PARENT COMPANY, ON MY IDENTICAL RIGHTANGLED REVIEW:Reply from Rightangled3 hours agoHi Leo,Thank you very much for your feedback and review. Rest assured that we listen to all feedback given so that we can provide a better service in the future.I have checked your account and can see that your Day 2 results are now ready. Your Day 8 sample was received by the lab on 8/8/2021 11:45:07 AM, meaning that you can expect to receive the results within 48 hours!If you are having difficulty navigating your online account, please contact our friendly Customer Service team for more help.You can also visit our FAQs page for further information.Kind regards,RickAND THIS IS MY REPLYThe response is factually incorrect on two counts:1) Our day 8 samples were delivered by Royal Mail on 07 August 2021 at 07:38, 08:04 and 08:05 respectively. I have tracking numbers proving this. They were not delivered on 08 August at 11:45 as stated. If it takes 27 hours to get from the postroom to the lab, then clearly there are some internal logistical issues. Which brings me to turnaround times:2) The advertised turnaround time, on the 0044 Covid Test website, is as follows (direct quote from the website):""Your results will be available online within 24 hours from the date the sample reaches the lab.""So not 48 hours as advised in the reply. We should have received them this morning. And if it takes 27 hours to reach the lab from the postroom, there isn\'t a chance in hell of meeting the advertised 24 hour turnaround time.I will let readers of this review make their own opinion of Rightangled, trading as 0044 Covid Test, and whether to use them in light of our experience and their response. I certainly won\'t in future.EDIT 25/AUG/2021: This company now trades under +44 COVID Test on the government approved list of covid test providers.\n            ', '\n                I have used this service for a group of 8 family members arriving to U.K. on 1st August from an amber list country.I’m quarantining with family in a privately rented place. We identified this website from the government approved list of firms. Our kits had arrived on time. We self swabbed on day2 and sent via Royal Mail tracking. According to the tracking the kits were received on our day 3 before 9 am but it’s end of our day 4 and the website and company is denying that the lab has received our test kits!!!Looking at the reviews it seems this is a very inefficient company who is not keeping up to their word. I’m truly worried that they will deny knowledge of receiving our day 8 kits as well and delay the quarantine period which is unacceptable They must be reported to relevant authorities and please consider legal action as a group\n            ', '\n                I have also reviewed rightangled.co as that\'s the actual provider of these test kits - 0044covidtest was the company that sold them to me when I picked them at random from the government webpage. Please let this be a warning to others not to do the same!I ordered my kit 10 days ahead of travel and that was fine - kits were delivered as promised.However, I am now on day 7 of quarantine and have had no results whatsoever. I posted my Day 2 kit on time and, fair enough, it was the weekend so Royal Mail tracked it as \'delivered\' on the morning of Day 5. That was 48 hours ago, and rightangled\'s web portal is still displaying ""awaiting return to lab"". My Day 5 \'test to release\' kit was delivered 24 hours ago and has the same status, so I\'m pessimistic about actually being released early at all.Since booking this kit, I read more about some of the other ones available. Choices are more limited outside of London, but I found at least one company that conducts \'at home\' test kits that you can process yourself via a Zoom call, thereby getting almost instant results. I would 100% book this in future - that way you could actually end your quarantine on Day 5 rather than getting your hopes up and still having to do all 10 days anyway!EDIT TO ADD: 36 hours after receiving Day 5 kit, and coincidentally at the exact same time as disputing this review, I was issued a \'test to release\' certificate. This is within the 24-48 hour promise, and I\'m delighted to be able to end my quarantine. Worth noting that Day 2 still does not appear to have been processed after 60 hours, so I can\'t help wondering whether Trustpilot reviews are actually the best way to nudge them into action!\n            ', '\n                Do not use this company.

Below is my battle with these people to get my results and my money back._____I posted my test to release sample on day 6 of my quarantine. Royal Mail\'s tracking service indicated that it arrived at it\'s destination on the morning of day 7.Bizarrely Rightangled\'s website didn\'t show the same information. It still said to the effect of ""waiting for delivery of sample"" on it\'s website\'s tracker.I emailed Rightangled to ask why Royal Mail had said they had delivered it but they hadn\'t acknowledged it on their end and they said ""Royal Mail takes up to 3 days to reach our labs."" which actually avoided answering my question as Royal Mail have already told me they delivered it in 24 hours using ""Royal Mail 24"".One of their service reps told me that I shouldn\'t have used Royal Mail 24 even though they included it with the pack and offered no warning that it might cause a delay. This is all nonsense though as we already know that Royal Mail delivered it in 24 hours and have confirmed this.They then told me that when the lab recives the sample that it will take up to two days to get a result.So in their own words, for a day 5 test to release pack: It takes up to 3 days to recieve the sample (apparently even if Royal Mail say they delivered it sooner) and then a further 2 days to get a result. Meaning you\'ll probably get a result on day 10 rendering the whole test to release scheme totally pointless.They still continue to sell these test packs on their website in spite of this obvious issue and it is stated that no refunds available for covid 19 testing.I finally received my result today (Day 12) far later than would have been useful. Afrer repeatedly pointing out my rights as per the 2015 Consumer Rights Act they eventually somewhat relented and refunded me for the cost of the tests (£60) but not the cost of delivery (£35) for this ""service"" which was pointlelssly petty considering everything they had put me though.I sent my day 8 test to a different provider named Biograd Diagnostics at 2pm on day 8 and recieved my result at 7:35pm the very next day. The postal service used?... Royal Mail 24.I read a lot of the reviews on here and assumed that only people who complained left reviews so I just dismissed them. That was my mistake.I would strongly recommend avoiding Rightangled and 0044CovidTest when it comes to doing covid testing. They are not capable of providing the service and should be removed from the government\'s list of providers in my view.\n            ', '\n                Shoddy resellers of a poor service.Don\'t get a day 5 test for ""Early release"".If Day 5 is a Monday, they might get it on a Tuesday, the delay is 48-72 hours(if you\'re lucky) so that\'s Friday - Day 9.

Day 1 after returning from overseas, I registered and completed the test on Saturday 11.30 or around noon. I suppose nobody works in these labs over the weekend. As Oncologica, a lab that is doing these tests for nomad travel, received my test on Monday around 7 pm. And I received the result on Tuesday 12.40. So from Saturday until Tuesday, that s 4 days. I suppose if it falls on a weekend, they re off at weekends....I was travelling from a green list country, so I was told by boss that I can come to work even before results are known. But if you want to know the results before you go to work....well plan to come back mid week, so you have time to get results on time to go to work. Anyway, that s my experience, delivery of the test was perfect, but I would expect results earlier. Otherwise I cannot fault the company, either nomad travel or Oncologica.

I booked the test 2 days before departure, and the test kit arrived the day after I landed. The kit came from Oncologica and was very easy to follow.. the details had all been pre-loaded on to the website for me and the results came 2 days after posting the kit back. It cost £55 which was very reasonable compared to other providers - my partner paid £90 and the process was harder to follow and slower (he had to enter all details himself and the kit only arrived on day 2).

My only feedback is that the in-clinic test is rather expensive (£215) and there are now more competitive prices from alternative providers.My in-home test experience was also very positive, I recently booked the day 2 & 8 home tests. I had an issue with my online payment which was sorted very quickly by their customer service, Rosie answered all my questions and was very helpful! The day 2 result arrived slightly delayed (on my quarantine day 5) but I believe this was for Royal Mail postage reasons (I posted my test on Sunday and despite the post box was listed online as a priority one, there was a notice saying they wouldn’t take any post that day - so I suspect my results didn’t arrive to the lab until Tuesday, my quarantine day 4, which means the lab did their job very quickly). The day 8 result (which I posted on a Saturday) arrived very promptly on my quarantine day 10 - so I was able to safely end my quarantine on day 11.

My wife\'s test however was not processed ""because she had somehow omitted her ethnicity"" (?what on earth this information is needed for I have no idea?). The staff member then asked a series of questions that made it sound like they were composing her record on line which included details that were not on the original form (!?). She refused to give any more information as it totally inappropriate what they were asking for.... surprisingly we both received negative certificates. However after that experience these were quite unbelievable. We are now back in NLD. Our trip was only to see our kids who we had not been able to see for a year. This was NOT a holiday.

Test was in stock again next day so I bought then. Email communication over this issue was rather slow, 3 days to reply to emergency issue of ordering. After that i found they had a fast chat feature, i turned there 2 times with issues and received replies fast even late. Very much appreciated. It's quite hidden, however.The registering system is rather stupid, but I'll take this small bother for the price. However, sends no email when you register your test, so I did have some anxiety if it all went through. I once forgot to write on the test tube and had to repack. Wish you didn't have to but I do believe YOU writing on it minimizes loss of tubes and general chaos by employee negligence.Test results on promised day when same day or next day test. However, be aware post shipment moves this by at least an extra day if day 5 test is required fast. I didn't mind.Overall, communication could be improved, as is usual for these test companies, but every test result was on time, which was great. Price is excellent compared to other companies!

In the first he made it clear that my failure to absorb the posting information buried deep in the blood test leaflet and work out the conflict with the cortisol test was entirely my fault, and in no way due to the lack of clarity in said information, or the fact that nowhere on the listing did it explain that all blood tests must be posted Thursday latest or risk being invalidated.But Mr S really upped his game when I tried to contact Blue Horizon live chat when my cortisol test went missing. Despite being first in the queue I was just left hanging for ten minutes or so with no response to my initial query. So I opened up an incognito window in Chrome and went into chat under a different name and email address and surprise, surprise, Mr S replied immediately! He then tried to pretend he had just stopped dealing with another customer, which was odd, given I was the customer at the head of the queue. Not content with blatantly lying, he then proceeded be about as difficult as he could about a cortisol replacement kit, saying it would need 'investigating' (despite the fact Blue Horizon has clearly not received any results in the last week). About five minutes later, I wanted to ask something else, but every time I tried the chat window, it mysteriously disappeared. Spooky!I can hand on heart say I have never seen anyone handle a customer so badly as Mr S. He could win some kind of award for being unhelpful. It's a real shame, because other than that, Blue Horizon seemed good value and quite efficient.

I sent for a really important blood test and I was waiting on the edge of my seat for results because they would dictate how I adjust my medication.

On top of it, now I am left in limbo as I don’t know how to adjust my medication. I am absolutely livid that they failed to process my sample. I do not accept a technical error as an excuse. In the hundreds of blood tests I have had elsewhere, not one person has ever failed to process my sample. Based on other reviews on here, they seem to make an awful lot of errors. For this reason, I would never use them again. I could never in right conscience recommend them to anyone. I’ve had fiery arguments with them over email (I was the fiery one as I’ve been affected; to them this doesn’t matter as their lives haven’t been affected).  It is my perception that they simply do not care just how much distress they have caused me by this error and it is also my opinion that they have not gone above and beyond to put it right. They offered me a new test or a refund. I would not take a new test without a refund on top of it because I don’t trust them to do the second test either. After more arguing, they promised a refund without further contact. Refund received three days later so at least if you have issues, you should feel assured you can get your money back. I told them I will tell everyone about my bad experience and they implied a threat of legal action if I do so. See their reviews on here and elsewhere and be the judge.

During numerous communications I have had with the Boots Customer Care Team, I stipulated that I wanted NO telephone contact with the Shrewsbury Optician, (so what did the Shrewsbury Optician do - Yes - they telephoned me!). And as I thought they would do, tried to put the blame back on myself as having cancelled the eye appointment with them just before Christmas of last year. They really should be asking themselves why I cancelled that appointment, (I knew very well that there was something definitely very wrong with my eyes), by that time lost all confidence with Boots Optician Shrewsbury! As a result I booked an appointment with an independent opticians in Shrewsbury, who gave me very thorough eye tests and confirmed that the cataracts in my eyes were definitely not ""the start of them"" forming. I might add the new Optician referred me to Spa Medica for treatment for my left eye, since then I have had the pre-op assessment, and now have an appointment for the one cataract to be removed this month. I might further add that my two brothers who have also been customers at Boots Opticians Shrewsbury for years and like myself back to the days when it was D&A, (so none of us are new customers), will no longer be going to Boots either, this particular branch of Boots Optician has now lost three customers.Moral of the story - go to a independent optician.To say I am very angry about the whole episode would be an understatement. I found Boots Customercare helpful to start with but now appear to be almost impossible to contact by telephone and emails are just ignored! I shall be contacting Optical Complaints in due course as the varifocal glasses prescribed last October are only any use for reading in the one eye, and absolutely no use for distance!

As a resident of the Netherlands I decided to trust the UK Govt that the companies on the list would at least function at a basic level. I paid 2x £128.99 for my wife and I to have Day 2 and Day 8 PCR test kits delivered to our accommodation.How wrong we were.The only good thing was that the PCR test packs for Day 2 and Day 8 were waiting for us at our accommodation.We dutifully performed our tests for Day 2 and Day 8 and sent them off.The forms were very hard to fill in. The instructions did not completely match the forms. Nothing was pre-printed. There were several fields asking for barcodes and reference numbers but absolutely NO guidance on which number went where. I am sure we made a mistake or two as they were so ambiguous.We did NOT receive the results of our Day 2 tests.Upon enquiring via the telephone, the company stated that the tests had not been received. We checked with the post office and they could see that the delivery had taken place.By the time came for our Day 8 tests we were paranoid and angry. We videoed ourselves posting the test boxes into the priority post box and after receiving nothing by day 10 checked again with the post office (again recording the event) and they confirmed that the tests had again been delivered to the Lab in Manchester (again).Upon enquiring via telephone the staff at the lab (Circular 1 Health Ltd in Manchester) confirmed that the tests had been located and that mine was OK and that they would send a certificate. My wife\'s test however was not processed ""because she had somehow omitted her ethnicity"" (?what on earth this information is needed for I have no idea?). The staff member then asked a series of questions that made it sound like they were composing her record on line which included details that were not on the original form (!?). She refused to give any more information as it totally inappropriate what they were asking for.... surprisingly we both received negative certificates. However after that experience these were quite unbelievable. We are now back in NLD. Our trip was only to see our kids who we had not been able to see for a year. This was NOT a holiday. We will not however be planning to return to UK for some time after this experience as to me the whole country has turned into a load of paranoid chin-wobblers. We had to do the enforced 10 days of ""house arrest"" on arrival (and yes we were checked on by NHS test and trace EVERY day, sometimes twice a day). For me the whole COVID19 scare is being used to scam us.

Either answer your message quicker or get a calling service who can answer the calls for you if you are too busy to speak to your customers yourself.  Noone wants to do these tests let alone pay the ridiculous prices that we all now have to pay, the least you could do is be available to answer questions.

Day 5 test-to-release test - sample posted Sunday morning, admittedly not picked up by Royal Mail until Monday morning, but even so results received on the following Saturday, e.g. would be day 11 of quarantine - which means he effectively paid to be released from quarantine early for nothing.Day 8 test - sample posted on Wednesday afternoon - Results received on the following Monday, e.g. would be day 13 of quarantine.The company blatantly admits that they do not process any samples at the weekend, so I have to ask - why sell a service that effectively is required 7/7 ?

Then, with the day 5 test, they confirmed receiving it on a Monday but only sent out the results that Friday. Even worse, the certificate was marked as the sample having been received on the Wednesday. So, not only did they either lie about receiving the test sample or not have it at all, they then went on to forge the actual document that would allow test to release, and that only arrived nearly a week after the covid test was taken.

Although the page where I bought the tests says they give 24 hour results, on their website's homepage they say results received after 2pm are counted as received the next business day. I checked the tracking and they received our samples just after 2pm on Day 3, so I assume they counted it as received in the morning of Day 4. I am now in the afternoon of Day 5 and still no result. Don't use this service if you want to get out of quarantine quickly.We rebooked our Day 5 test with a provider that gives same day results.

First of all, my kits arrived two days late. I sent in my Day 2 test as soon as I received it, but after five days I still never received results. I tried to get in touch with the company but they essentially ignored my WhatsApp messaged. They did, however, respond to a separate email simply telling me that the package never arrived. They\'re the ones who set up the package and presumably have the tracking info, but no more details were provided. Beyond these perfunctory responses they were not helpful whatsoever. When Day 8 came around I wondered if I should even send in my second test ... after all, what was the point? I\'m fully vaccinated and hadn\'t even been contacted by the NHS since arriving. This whole thing felt like a disorganized money grab. So I didn\'t send in the Day 8. And guess what: nothing happened. I found a place I could walk into to get a same day rapid PCR in order to fly out of the country. That worked fine. If you look into this company it\'s clear that it\'s a shady operation. Its ""office address"" is actually a front created by one of those shell companies you pay to set up a pseudo business address when you don\'t have a real office. It was also only incorporated a couple months ago, which is a bit of a red flag. I couldn\'t find any information on the person who apparently owns the company: Mr Nabil Sodfi. But the whole enterprise just seems sketchy. At best this is just a poorly run government-sanctioned grift.  I hope once the pandemic is over these pandemic profiteers, including the government goons who mandated this pointless and inefficient exercise, will be held to account.\n            ', '\n                Day 2 test arrived on time, did the test on a Friday morning, following the instructions, posted at lunchtime, results on Friday afternoon at normal Priority mail box, no drop off box needed. £65. Only thing to complain about was the cost! Everything else was fine.\n            ', ""\n                The only good thing I can say about this company, is that it does not take them too long to reply to your emails. Well, it also depends on what the email is about. I paid £190 for day 2, 5 (early release) and 8 tests. As soon as I ordered the tests, I got worried that I had been scammed, as I didn't get any confirmation email or receipt. I went on their website just to find an email and a WhatsApp number that says 'message only', which did not seem too professional to me at all. To give them some credit, they did reply quite fast, and sent me the confirmation with the Royal Mail tracking no. On their website, the company also promises that you get the results within 24 hours. In my case, on day 5 of my quarantine (Wednesday, late evening), I received the results for the test I had sent on day 3 (Monday, morning). This is more than 48 hours! Then, when I had concerns in regard to my early release day 5 test results  (I paid £60 for this one, as I had reasons to leave the house as soon as I could), I was told that the day 5 tests were prioritised and that I was going to get them as soon as possible. To put it in perspective, I sent my test on day 5 (Wednesday) early in the day, because it was 10am. When I contacted them the following day (Thursday), I was told that the tests hadn't arrived at the lab yet. Now I'm on day 7 of my quarantine, no email has come through and it seems like the company has been struggling to reply to all my previous emails, ever since I asked for a refund for (at least) my day 5 tests. I'll be leaving the quarantine in 3 days, so it really doesn't make sense for me to pay this amount of money for the test that doesn't do it's job. The issue here is that there is no law protecting the customers should they receive their test results later than they were meant to. And on top of that, there are so many people getting the tests, that you are not a customer the company needs to keep in order to survive. So basically, as soon as you pay, you're fu*ked.\n            "", '\n                Do not use. After paying almost £200 for test and release the tests did not arrive.
