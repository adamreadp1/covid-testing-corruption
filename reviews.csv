I read that you must order test kits (in my case Day 2 Covid kit) at least a week earlier. I ordered it 10 days earlier. I received it on day 1 and it was perfect. Day 1 after returning from overseas, I registered and completed the test on Saturday 11.30 or around noon. I suppose nobody works in these labs over the weekend. As Oncologica, a lab that is doing these tests for nomad travel, received my test on Monday around 7 pm. And I received the result on Tuesday 12.40. So from Saturday until Tuesday, that s 4 days. I suppose if it falls on a weekend, they re off at weekends....I was travelling from a green list country, so I was told by boss that I can come to work even before results are known. But if you want to know the results before you go to work....well plan to come back mid week, so you have time to get results on time to go to work. Anyway, that s my experience, delivery of the test was perfect, but I would expect results earlier. Otherwise I cannot fault the company, either nomad travel or Oncologica. Nomad travel had the cheapest prices of all the other labs, and some of those labs are really dodgy, so I would recommend this company. Thank you.\n            ', '\n                Family member used this company after returning from a amber country. They use oncologica which has shocking reviews.Day 6 and still no sign of the day 2 results.   They refuse to recognise the Royal Mail delivery time and send a email when they scan the item.

Can only comment on our recent experience; all very positive. We ordered Day 2 kits in France, driving to our ferry on 15th August, after belatedly realising we needed a test reference number on the UK passenger locator form!  At £55 they were not the most expensive, nor the least, but all courier and return postage included...unlike other providers who slap £25+ on at the end of your order!  The kits arrived within the specified delivery hour on 17th August. We returned same day through priority Royal Mail post box -easy. Despite forgetting to scan our kit barcodes into the Coronfocus App (reminder instructions to do this could be included in the kit, although are in the original confirmation email) we have our results today -20th August.

I had to pay another £185 for an ""on the day"" test from a different provider and my test from Nomad/Oncologica was a complete waste of money not to mention the enormous stress of trying to decide what to do when the results still hadn\'t arrived just before my flight.

It cost £55 which was very reasonable compared to other providers - my partner paid £90 and the process was harder to follow and slower (he had to enter all details himself and the kit only arrived on day 2).

In their booking system you could see all the bookings they made for this Day2 tests, 8 in total on the 16 July.

My only feedback is that the in-clinic test is rather expensive (£215) and there are now more competitive prices from alternative providers.My in-home test experience was also very positive, I recently booked the day 2 & 8 home tests. I had an issue with my online payment which was sorted very quickly by their customer service, Rosie answered all my questions and was very helpful! The day 2 result arrived slightly delayed (on my quarantine day 5) but I believe this was for Royal Mail postage reasons (I posted my test on Sunday and despite the post box was listed online as a priority one, there was a notice saying they wouldn’t take any post that day - so I suspect my results didn’t arrive to the lab until Tuesday, my quarantine day 4, which means the lab did their job very quickly). The day 8 result (which I posted on a Saturday) arrived very promptly on my quarantine day 10 - so I was able to safely end my quarantine on day 11.

My only criticism is that there is no way to register a child's test within a parent's account.  You have to create a separate account for each person, for which you need an email address.

That company got us our results within 24 hours - but we couldn\'t exit isolation because none of our day 2 tests were back!We went with 0044 Covid Test / Rightangled because they were on the government approved list, and were generally cheaper than other providers. Well I guess you get what you pay for - go ""cheap"", get poor service. I have since found out that the company has previously allegedly been reprimanded by the regulator UKAS, and accused of defrauding New Yorkers by the State\'s Attorney General, as reported by The Times in May 2020.Not fit for purpose, avoid at all costs.THIS IS THE REPLY FROM RIGHTANGLED, 0044 COVID TEST\'S PARENT COMPANY, ON MY IDENTICAL RIGHTANGLED REVIEW:Reply from Rightangled3 hours agoHi Leo,Thank you very much for your feedback and review. Rest assured that we listen to all feedback given so that we can provide a better service in the future.I have checked your account and can see that your Day 2 results are now ready. Your Day 8 sample was received by the lab on 8/8/2021 11:45:07 AM, meaning that you can expect to receive the results within 48 hours!If you are having difficulty navigating your online account, please contact our friendly Customer Service team for more help.You can also visit our FAQs page for further information.Kind regards,RickAND THIS IS MY REPLYThe response is factually incorrect on two counts:1) Our day 8 samples were delivered by Royal Mail on 07 August 2021 at 07:38, 08:04 and 08:05 respectively. I have tracking numbers proving this. They were not delivered on 08 August at 11:45 as stated. If it takes 27 hours to get from the postroom to the lab, then clearly there are some internal logistical issues. Which brings me to turnaround times:2) The advertised turnaround time, on the 0044 Covid Test website, is as follows (direct quote from the website):""Your results will be available online within 24 hours from the date the sample reaches the lab.""So not 48 hours as advised in the reply. We should have received them this morning. And if it takes 27 hours to reach the lab from the postroom, there isn\'t a chance in hell of meeting the advertised 24 hour turnaround time.I will let readers of this review make their own opinion of Rightangled, trading as 0044 Covid Test, and whether to use them in light of our experience and their response. I certainly won\'t in future.EDIT 25/AUG/2021: This company now trades under +44 COVID Test on the government approved list of covid test providers.\n            ', '\n                I have used this service for a group of 8 family members arriving to U.K. on 1st August from an amber list country.I’m quarantining with family in a privately rented place. We identified this website from the government approved list of firms. Our kits had arrived on time. We self swabbed on day2 and sent via Royal Mail tracking. According to the tracking the kits were received on our day 3 before 9 am but it’s end of our day 4 and the website and company is denying that the lab has received our test kits!!!Looking at the reviews it seems this is a very inefficient company who is not keeping up to their word. I’m truly worried that they will deny knowledge of receiving our day 8 kits as well and delay the quarantine period which is unacceptable They must be reported to relevant authorities and please consider legal action as a group\n            ', '\n                I have also reviewed rightangled.co as that\'s the actual provider of these test kits - 0044covidtest was the company that sold them to me when I picked them at random from the government webpage. Please let this be a warning to others not to do the same!I ordered my kit 10 days ahead of travel and that was fine - kits were delivered as promised.However, I am now on day 7 of quarantine and have had no results whatsoever. I posted my Day 2 kit on time and, fair enough, it was the weekend so Royal Mail tracked it as \'delivered\' on the morning of Day 5. That was 48 hours ago, and rightangled\'s web portal is still displaying ""awaiting return to lab"". My Day 5 \'test to release\' kit was delivered 24 hours ago and has the same status, so I\'m pessimistic about actually being released early at all.Since booking this kit, I read more about some of the other ones available. Choices are more limited outside of London, but I found at least one company that conducts \'at home\' test kits that you can process yourself via a Zoom call, thereby getting almost instant results. I would 100% book this in future - that way you could actually end your quarantine on Day 5 rather than getting your hopes up and still having to do all 10 days anyway!EDIT TO ADD: 36 hours after receiving Day 5 kit, and coincidentally at the exact same time as disputing this review, I was issued a \'test to release\' certificate. This is within the 24-48 hour promise, and I\'m delighted to be able to end my quarantine.

Royal Mail\'s tracking service indicated that it arrived at it\'s destination on the morning of day 7.Bizarrely Rightangled\'s website didn\'t show the same information. It still said to the effect of ""waiting for delivery of sample"" on it\'s website\'s tracker.I emailed Rightangled to ask why Royal Mail had said they had delivered it but they hadn\'t acknowledged it on their end and they said ""Royal Mail takes up to 3 days to reach our labs."" which actually avoided answering my question as Royal Mail have already told me they delivered it in 24 hours using ""Royal Mail 24"".One of their service reps told me that I shouldn\'t have used Royal Mail 24 even though they included it with the pack and offered no warning that it might cause a delay. This is all nonsense though as we already know that Royal Mail delivered it in 24 hours and have confirmed this.They then told me that when the lab recives the sample that it will take up to two days to get a result.So in their own words, for a day 5 test to release pack: It takes up to 3 days to recieve the sample (apparently even if Royal Mail say they delivered it sooner) and then a further 2 days to get a result. Meaning you\'ll probably get a result on day 10 rendering the whole test to release scheme totally pointless.They still continue to sell these test packs on their website in spite of this obvious issue and it is stated that no refunds available for covid 19 testing.I finally received my result today (Day 12) far later than would have been useful. Afrer repeatedly pointing out my rights as per the 2015 Consumer Rights Act they eventually somewhat relented and refunded me for the cost of the tests (£60) but not the cost of delivery (£35) for this ""service"" which was pointlelssly petty considering everything they had put me though.I sent my day 8 test to a different provider named Biograd Diagnostics at 2pm on day 8 and recieved my result at 7:35pm the very next day. The postal service used?... Royal Mail 24.I read a lot of the reviews on here and assumed that only people who complained left reviews so I just dismissed them.

After wasting hours attempting to contact the company I had to buy another kit from another provider in order to travel.I immediately sent an email asking for a refund and the following day received an email apologising for the error and assuring me I would be refunded.11 days later and after more emails and a phone call I am still waiting.Now the phone number goes directly to a full mailbox so I can’t even talk to anyone in their office.I suspect their policy is to hope disappointed customers give up and get on with their lives but I’m stubborn and stupid enough to spend thousands to get my 80 quid back. Stay away from this bunch of opportunists.Edit: Several emails later I did receive my money back, but the point remains that you cannot contact their office out of hours or at weekends and as many people book these day2 tests greatly for travel the next day or so it’s important to be able to get in touch ASAP if there is an issue with the reference number they provide.\n            ', '\n                We’ve used them for our Day 2 test, it was little bit more expensive than other providers, but next day delivery was a plus.

Rest assured that we listen to all feedback given so that we can provide a better service in the future.I have checked your account and can see that your Day 2 results are now ready. Your Day 8 sample was received by the lab on 8/8/2021 11:45:07 AM, meaning that you can expect to receive the results within 48 hours!If you are having difficulty navigating your online account, please contact our friendly Customer Service team for more help.You can also visit our FAQs page for further information.Kind regards,RickAND THIS IS MY REPLYThe response is factually incorrect on two counts:1) Our day 8 samples were delivered by Royal Mail on 07 August 2021 at 07:38, 08:04 and 08:05 respectively. I have tracking numbers proving this. They were not delivered on 08 August at 11:45 as stated. If it takes 27 hours to get from the postroom to the lab, then clearly there are some internal logistical issues. Which brings me to turnaround times:2) The advertised turnaround time, on the 0044 Covid Test website, is as follows (direct quote from the website):""Your results will be available online within 24 hours from the date the sample reaches the lab.""So not 48 hours as advised in the reply. We should have received them this morning. And if it takes 27 hours to reach the lab from the postroom, there isn\'t a chance in hell of meeting the advertised 24 hour turnaround time.I will let readers of this review make their own opinion of Rightangled, trading as 0044 Covid Test, and whether to use them in light of our experience and their response. I certainly won\'t in future.EDIT 25/AUG/2021: This company now trades under +44 COVID Test on the government approved list of covid test providers.\n            ', '\n                I have used this service for a group of 8 family members arriving to U.K. on 1st August from an amber list country.I’m quarantining with family in a privately rented place. We identified this website from the government approved list of firms. Our kits had arrived on time. We self swabbed on day2 and sent via Royal Mail tracking. According to the tracking the kits were received on our day 3 before 9 am but it’s end of our day 4 and the website and company is denying that the lab has received our test kits!!!Looking at the reviews it seems this is a very inefficient company who is not keeping up to their word. I’m truly worried that they will deny knowledge of receiving our day 8 kits as well and delay the quarantine period which is unacceptable They must be reported to relevant authorities and please consider legal action as a group\n            ', '\n                I have also reviewed rightangled.co as that\'s the actual provider of these test kits - 0044covidtest was the company that sold them to me when I picked them at random from the government webpage. Please let this be a warning to others not to do the same!I ordered my kit 10 days ahead of travel and that was fine - kits were delivered as promised.However, I am now on day 7 of quarantine and have had no results whatsoever. I posted my Day 2 kit on time and, fair enough, it was the weekend so Royal Mail tracked it as \'delivered\' on the morning of Day 5. That was 48 hours ago, and rightangled\'s web portal is still displaying ""awaiting return to lab"". My Day 5 \'test to release\' kit was delivered 24 hours ago and has the same status, so I\'m pessimistic about actually being released early at all.Since booking this kit, I read more about some of the other ones available. Choices are more limited outside of London, but I found at least one company that conducts \'at home\' test kits that you can process yourself via a Zoom call, thereby getting almost instant results. I would 100% book this in future - that way you could actually end your quarantine on Day 5 rather than getting your hopes up and still having to do all 10 days anyway!EDIT TO ADD: 36 hours after receiving Day 5 kit, and coincidentally at the exact same time as disputing this review, I was issued a \'test to release\' certificate. This is within the 24-48 hour promise, and I\'m delighted to be able to end my quarantine.

Royal Mail\'s tracking service indicated that it arrived at it\'s destination on the morning of day 7.Bizarrely Rightangled\'s website didn\'t show the same information. It still said to the effect of ""waiting for delivery of sample"" on it\'s website\'s tracker.I emailed Rightangled to ask why Royal Mail had said they had delivered it but they hadn\'t acknowledged it on their end and they said ""Royal Mail takes up to 3 days to reach our labs."" which actually avoided answering my question as Royal Mail have already told me they delivered it in 24 hours using ""Royal Mail 24"".One of their service reps told me that I shouldn\'t have used Royal Mail 24 even though they included it with the pack and offered no warning that it might cause a delay. This is all nonsense though as we already know that Royal Mail delivered it in 24 hours and have confirmed this.They then told me that when the lab recives the sample that it will take up to two days to get a result.So in their own words, for a day 5 test to release pack: It takes up to 3 days to recieve the sample (apparently even if Royal Mail say they delivered it sooner) and then a further 2 days to get a result. Meaning you\'ll probably get a result on day 10 rendering the whole test to release scheme totally pointless.They still continue to sell these test packs on their website in spite of this obvious issue and it is stated that no refunds available for covid 19 testing.I finally received my result today (Day 12) far later than would have been useful. Afrer repeatedly pointing out my rights as per the 2015 Consumer Rights Act they eventually somewhat relented and refunded me for the cost of the tests (£60) but not the cost of delivery (£35) for this ""service"" which was pointlelssly petty considering everything they had put me though.I sent my day 8 test to a different provider named Biograd Diagnostics at 2pm on day 8 and recieved my result at 7:35pm the very next day. The postal service used?... Royal Mail 24.I read a lot of the reviews on here and assumed that only people who complained left reviews so I just dismissed them.

The sample was never tested, despite repeated emails to the company asking for it. The Day 8 test was also sent off, and this time was tested. Weeks later, still no Day 2 result, We have since requested a partial refund for the Day 2 test which they never processed, and we told they have a zero refunds policy.

I decided to take the gamble as they were so much cheaper than many other test providers.  I booked 3 day 2 tests, which were delivered within a couple of days.   We had no problem undertaking the tests after our trip - instructions were very clear.  I made a mistake registering my test so i called the customer service team who quickly helped resolve the issue.  We sent our tests off via Royal Mail using the prepaid envelopes provided on a Tuesday and got the results on the Friday - so exactly as promised.  My only criticism is that there is no way to register a child's test within a parent's account.  You have to create a separate account for each person, for which you need an email address.  Being 5, my son doesn't have one, so I had to use my work email, which is not ideal.\n            "", '\n                We purchased three day 2 & 8 Covid PCR tests from 0044 Covid Test, aka Rightangled. They promise results within 24 hours of test receipt on their website. We are on day 10 of isolation. My wife\'s day 2 result was received on day 8. I got mine on day 9. As for my son\'s, we\'re still waiting on day 10.We also sent our day 8 tests two days ago. Royal Mail delivered them yesterday at 08:05. Rightangled haven\'t turned these tests around within the advertised 24 hour period - in fact, their online portal still advises that they haven\'t received them!This is particularly frustrating, as we purchased day 5 test to release with another company at significant cost. That company got us our results within 24 hours - but we couldn\'t exit isolation because none of our day 2 tests were back!We went with 0044 Covid Test / Rightangled because they were on the government approved list, and were generally cheaper than other providers. Well I guess you get what you pay for - go ""cheap"", get poor service. I have since found out that the company has previously allegedly been reprimanded by the regulator UKAS, and accused of defrauding New Yorkers by the State\'s Attorney General, as reported by The Times in May 2020.Not fit for purpose, avoid at all costs.THIS IS THE REPLY FROM RIGHTANGLED, 0044 COVID TEST\'S PARENT COMPANY, ON MY IDENTICAL RIGHTANGLED REVIEW:Reply from Rightangled3 hours agoHi Leo,Thank you very much for your feedback and review. Rest assured that we listen to all feedback given so that we can provide a better service in the future.I have checked your account and can see that your Day 2 results are now ready. Your Day 8 sample was received by the lab on 8/8/2021 11:45:07 AM, meaning that you can expect to receive the results within 48 hours!If you are having difficulty navigating your online account, please contact our friendly Customer Service team for more help.You can also visit our FAQs page for further information.Kind regards,RickAND THIS IS MY REPLYThe response is factually incorrect on two counts:1) Our day 8 samples were delivered by Royal Mail on 07 August 2021 at 07:38, 08:04 and 08:05 respectively. I have tracking numbers proving this. They were not delivered on 08 August at 11:45 as stated. If it takes 27 hours to get from the postroom to the lab, then clearly there are some internal logistical issues. Which brings me to turnaround times:2) The advertised turnaround time, on the 0044 Covid Test website, is as follows (direct quote from the website):""Your results will be available online within 24 hours from the date the sample reaches the lab.""So not 48 hours as advised in the reply. We should have received them this morning. And if it takes 27 hours to reach the lab from the postroom, there isn\'t a chance in hell of meeting the advertised 24 hour turnaround time.I will let readers of this review make their own opinion of Rightangled, trading as 0044 Covid Test, and whether to use them in light of our experience and their response. I certainly won\'t in future.EDIT 25/AUG/2021: This company now trades under +44 COVID Test on the government approved list of covid test providers.\n            ', '\n                I have used this service for a group of 8 family members arriving to U.K. on 1st August from an amber list country.I’m quarantining with family in a privately rented place. We identified this website from the government approved list of firms. Our kits had arrived on time. We self swabbed on day2 and sent via Royal Mail tracking. According to the tracking the kits were received on our day 3 before 9 am but it’s end of our day 4 and the website and company is denying that the lab has received our test kits!!!Looking at the reviews it seems this is a very inefficient company who is not keeping up to their word. I’m truly worried that they will deny knowledge of receiving our day 8 kits as well and delay the quarantine period which is unacceptable They must be reported to relevant authorities and please consider legal action as a group\n            ', '\n                I have also reviewed rightangled.co as that\'s the actual provider of these test kits - 0044covidtest was the company that sold them to me when I picked them at random from the government webpage. Please let this be a warning to others not to do the same!I ordered my kit 10 days ahead of travel and that was fine - kits were delivered as promised.However, I am now on day 7 of quarantine and have had no results whatsoever. I posted my Day 2 kit on time and, fair enough, it was the weekend so Royal Mail tracked it as \'delivered\' on the morning of Day 5. That was 48 hours ago, and rightangled\'s web portal is still displaying ""awaiting return to lab"". My Day 5 \'test to release\' kit was delivered 24 hours ago and has the same status, so I\'m pessimistic about actually being released early at all.Since booking this kit, I read more about some of the other ones available. Choices are more limited outside of London, but I found at least one company that conducts \'at home\' test kits that you can process yourself via a Zoom call, thereby getting almost instant results. I would 100% book this in future - that way you could actually end your quarantine on Day 5 rather than getting your hopes up and still having to do all 10 days anyway!EDIT TO ADD: 36 hours after receiving Day 5 kit, and coincidentally at the exact same time as disputing this review, I was issued a \'test to release\' certificate. This is within the 24-48 hour promise, and I\'m delighted to be able to end my quarantine. Worth noting that Day 2 still does not appear to have been processed after 60 hours, so I can\'t help wondering whether Trustpilot reviews are actually the best way to nudge them into action!\n            ', '\n                Do not use this company.

They have no tests or appointments.\n            ', '\n                Super slow turn around of results. Day 5 test to release, back late on day 9 ... Glad we spunked cash on that then.\n            ', '\n                Another slimy company cashing in on the pandemic. No refunds policy after charging £190 for 3 simple tests? Disgusting.\n            ', ""\n                Unacceptably poor service from 0044 Covid Test / Rightangled. No acknowledgment of recieving samples despite confirmation of delivery via Royal Mail tracking. No result from Day 2 despite posting sample on time (currently on Day 9).I encourage all customers who have experienced this service report the company to dhsctesttrace.customerfeedbackteam at nhs.net to get them taken off the approved government list so they stop taking people's money.\n            "", '\n                0044 Covid Testing is some sort of subsidiary/reseller of a company called Rightangled.co you should avoid them. When you purchase a test from 0044Covidtest you are in fact dealing with Rightangled which isn\'t made clear on their website. Below is my battle with these people to get my results and my money back._____I posted my test to release sample on day 6 of my quarantine. Royal Mail\'s tracking service indicated that it arrived at it\'s destination on the morning of day 7.Bizarrely Rightangled\'s website didn\'t show the same information. It still said to the effect of ""waiting for delivery of sample"" on it\'s website\'s tracker.I emailed Rightangled to ask why Royal Mail had said they had delivered it but they hadn\'t acknowledged it on their end and they said ""Royal Mail takes up to 3 days to reach our labs."" which actually avoided answering my question as Royal Mail have already told me they delivered it in 24 hours using ""Royal Mail 24"".One of their service reps told me that I shouldn\'t have used Royal Mail 24 even though they included it with the pack and offered no warning that it might cause a delay. This is all nonsense though as we already know that Royal Mail delivered it in 24 hours and have confirmed this.They then told me that when the lab recives the sample that it will take up to two days to get a result.So in their own words, for a day 5 test to release pack: It takes up to 3 days to recieve the sample (apparently even if Royal Mail say they delivered it sooner) and then a further 2 days to get a result. Meaning you\'ll probably get a result on day 10 rendering the whole test to release scheme totally pointless.They still continue to sell these test packs on their website in spite of this obvious issue and it is stated that no refunds available for covid 19 testing.I finally received my result today (Day 12) far later than would have been useful. Afrer repeatedly pointing out my rights as per the 2015 Consumer Rights Act they eventually somewhat relented and refunded me for the cost of the tests (£60) but not the cost of delivery (£35) for this ""service"" which was pointlelssly petty considering everything they had put me though.I sent my day 8 test to a different provider named Biograd Diagnostics at 2pm on day 8 and recieved my result at 7:35pm the very next day. The postal service used?... Royal Mail 24.I read a lot of the reviews on here and assumed that only people who complained left reviews so I just dismissed them. That was my mistake.I would strongly recommend avoiding Rightangled and 0044CovidTest when it comes to doing covid testing. They are not capable of providing the service and should be removed from the government\'s list of providers in my view.\n            ', '\n                Shoddy resellers of a poor service.Don\'t get a day 5 test for ""Early release"".If Day 5 is a Monday, they might get it on a Tuesday, the delay is 48-72 hours(if you\'re lucky) so that\'s Friday - Day 9.  If there\'s a weekend involved, you\'ll get it on Day 11.  After your release.And yes, this is exactly my experience.\n            ', ""\n                Absolutely appalling!

Rest assured that we listen to all feedback given so that we can provide a better service in the future.I have checked your account and can see that your Day 2 results are now ready. Your Day 8 sample was received by the lab on 8/8/2021 11:45:07 AM, meaning that you can expect to receive the results within 48 hours!If you are having difficulty navigating your online account, please contact our friendly Customer Service team for more help.You can also visit our FAQs page for further information.Kind regards,RickAND THIS IS MY REPLYThe response is factually incorrect on two counts:1) Our day 8 samples were delivered by Royal Mail on 07 August 2021 at 07:38, 08:04 and 08:05 respectively. I have tracking numbers proving this. They were not delivered on 08 August at 11:45 as stated. If it takes 27 hours to get from the postroom to the lab, then clearly there are some internal logistical issues. Which brings me to turnaround times:2) The advertised turnaround time, on the 0044 Covid Test website, is as follows (direct quote from the website):""Your results will be available online within 24 hours from the date the sample reaches the lab.""So not 48 hours as advised in the reply. We should have received them this morning. And if it takes 27 hours to reach the lab from the postroom, there isn\'t a chance in hell of meeting the advertised 24 hour turnaround time.I will let readers of this review make their own opinion of Rightangled, trading as 0044 Covid Test, and whether to use them in light of our experience and their response. I certainly won\'t in future.EDIT 25/AUG/2021: This company now trades under +44 COVID Test on the government approved list of covid test providers.\n            ', '\n                I have used this service for a group of 8 family members arriving to U.K. on 1st August from an amber list country.I’m quarantining with family in a privately rented place. We identified this website from the government approved list of firms. Our kits had arrived on time. We self swabbed on day2 and sent via Royal Mail tracking. According to the tracking the kits were received on our day 3 before 9 am but it’s end of our day 4 and the website and company is denying that the lab has received our test kits!!!Looking at the reviews it seems this is a very inefficient company who is not keeping up to their word. I’m truly worried that they will deny knowledge of receiving our day 8 kits as well and delay the quarantine period which is unacceptable They must be reported to relevant authorities and please consider legal action as a group\n            ', '\n                I have also reviewed rightangled.co as that\'s the actual provider of these test kits - 0044covidtest was the company that sold them to me when I picked them at random from the government webpage. Please let this be a warning to others not to do the same!I ordered my kit 10 days ahead of travel and that was fine - kits were delivered as promised.However, I am now on day 7 of quarantine and have had no results whatsoever. I posted my Day 2 kit on time and, fair enough, it was the weekend so Royal Mail tracked it as \'delivered\' on the morning of Day 5. That was 48 hours ago, and rightangled\'s web portal is still displaying ""awaiting return to lab"". My Day 5 \'test to release\' kit was delivered 24 hours ago and has the same status, so I\'m pessimistic about actually being released early at all.Since booking this kit, I read more about some of the other ones available. Choices are more limited outside of London, but I found at least one company that conducts \'at home\' test kits that you can process yourself via a Zoom call, thereby getting almost instant results. I would 100% book this in future - that way you could actually end your quarantine on Day 5 rather than getting your hopes up and still having to do all 10 days anyway!EDIT TO ADD: 36 hours after receiving Day 5 kit, and coincidentally at the exact same time as disputing this review, I was issued a \'test to release\' certificate. This is within the 24-48 hour promise, and I\'m delighted to be able to end my quarantine. Worth noting that Day 2 still does not appear to have been processed after 60 hours, so I can\'t help wondering whether Trustpilot reviews are actually the best way to nudge them into action!\n            ', '\n                Do not use this company.

No acknowledgment of recieving samples despite confirmation of delivery via Royal Mail tracking. No result from Day 2 despite posting sample on time (currently on Day 9).I encourage all customers who have experienced this service report the company to dhsctesttrace.customerfeedbackteam at nhs.net to get them taken off the approved government list so they stop taking people's money.\n            "", '\n                0044 Covid Testing is some sort of subsidiary/reseller of a company called Rightangled.co you should avoid them. When you purchase a test from 0044Covidtest you are in fact dealing with Rightangled which isn\'t made clear on their website. Below is my battle with these people to get my results and my money back._____I posted my test to release sample on day 6 of my quarantine. Royal Mail\'s tracking service indicated that it arrived at it\'s destination on the morning of day 7.Bizarrely Rightangled\'s website didn\'t show the same information. It still said to the effect of ""waiting for delivery of sample"" on it\'s website\'s tracker.I emailed Rightangled to ask why Royal Mail had said they had delivered it but they hadn\'t acknowledged it on their end and they said ""Royal Mail takes up to 3 days to reach our labs."" which actually avoided answering my question as Royal Mail have already told me they delivered it in 24 hours using ""Royal Mail 24"".One of their service reps told me that I shouldn\'t have used Royal Mail 24 even though they included it with the pack and offered no warning that it might cause a delay. This is all nonsense though as we already know that Royal Mail delivered it in 24 hours and have confirmed this.They then told me that when the lab recives the sample that it will take up to two days to get a result.So in their own words, for a day 5 test to release pack: It takes up to 3 days to recieve the sample (apparently even if Royal Mail say they delivered it sooner) and then a further 2 days to get a result. Meaning you\'ll probably get a result on day 10 rendering the whole test to release scheme totally pointless.They still continue to sell these test packs on their website in spite of this obvious issue and it is stated that no refunds available for covid 19 testing.I finally received my result today (Day 12) far later than would have been useful. Afrer repeatedly pointing out my rights as per the 2015 Consumer Rights Act they eventually somewhat relented and refunded me for the cost of the tests (£60) but not the cost of delivery (£35) for this ""service"" which was pointlelssly petty considering everything they had put me though.I sent my day 8 test to a different provider named Biograd Diagnostics at 2pm on day 8 and recieved my result at 7:35pm the very next day.

Day 1 after returning from overseas, I registered and completed the test on Saturday 11.30 or around noon. I suppose nobody works in these labs over the weekend. As Oncologica, a lab that is doing these tests for nomad travel, received my test on Monday around 7 pm. And I received the result on Tuesday 12.40. So from Saturday until Tuesday, that s 4 days. I suppose if it falls on a weekend, they re off at weekends....I was travelling from a green list country, so I was told by boss that I can come to work even before results are known. But if you want to know the results before you go to work....well plan to come back mid week, so you have time to get results on time to go to work. Anyway, that s my experience, delivery of the test was perfect, but I would expect results earlier. Otherwise I cannot fault the company, either nomad travel or Oncologica. Nomad travel had the cheapest prices of all the other labs, and some of those labs are really dodgy, so I would recommend this company.

My wife\'s test however was not processed ""because she had somehow omitted her ethnicity"" (?what on earth this information is needed for I have no idea?). The staff member then asked a series of questions that made it sound like they were composing her record on line which included details that were not on the original form (!?). She refused to give any more information as it totally inappropriate what they were asking for.... surprisingly we both received negative certificates.

I carried out the test fine and was prompted by the instructions to then register my unique URN number online, which you have to enter once and a second time to confirm. I started to do this first on my mobile and a message 'Invalid URN' came up.

Then I thought to begin with I will first find definition of best customer services from Google.I found this :Excellent customer service means going beyond meeting your customer's basic needs. It involves much more than providing support in a timely and pleasant manner. More importantly, it means doing everything possible so your customers are not merely satisfied. They're actually happy with your products and services.I think if I have to describe excellent service then it can be described in two words:  Hasu Diagnostic.I would highly recommend Hasu diagnostics if you have to do a fit to fly test and other covid test requirements for travelling or any other purposes.\n            "", '\n                Hasu Diagnostics is doing a great job, with good service and  a team that answers the phone and helps solve any issues.

I opted for the same day result which BTW was not charged a PREMIUM price for like others quoting £199 but a fair price of £74 ..went onsite to do the test with a family of 4x today at around 1pm and received the certified RT PCR fit for to certificates results via their online portal by late evening! I noticed I made an error on my address and called them around 9pm and did not expect anyone to answer but they did! Asked to email in to which I received a response instantly with the error amended and file updated!

Now include prepaid labels as well, nice change.Ordered just as the change in system came so I think online orders are easier now, my experience was a 2/5, confusing emails when i hadn't paid yet, randomly ran out of stock as it seemed to reserve a test for me even before i paid, when paypal bugged out it showed no test available so I had a panic moment. Test was in stock again next day so I bought then. Email communication over this issue was rather slow, 3 days to reply to emergency issue of ordering. After that i found they had a fast chat feature, i turned there 2 times with issues and received replies fast even late. Very much appreciated. It's quite hidden, however.The registering system is rather stupid, but I'll take this small bother for the price. However, sends no email when you register your test, so I did have some anxiety if it all went through. I once forgot to write on the test tube and had to repack. Wish you didn't have to but I do believe YOU writing on it minimizes loss of tubes and general chaos by employee negligence.Test results on promised day when same day or next day test. However, be aware post shipment moves this by at least an extra day if day 5 test is required fast. I didn't mind.Overall, communication could be improved, as is usual for these test companies, but every test result was on time, which was great. Price is excellent compared to other companies!

Despite being first in the queue I was just left hanging for ten minutes or so with no response to my initial query. So I opened up an incognito window in Chrome and went into chat under a different name and email address and surprise, surprise, Mr S replied immediately! He then tried to pretend he had just stopped dealing with another customer, which was odd, given I was the customer at the head of the queue.

About five minutes later, I wanted to ask something else, but every time I tried the chat window, it mysteriously disappeared. Spooky!I can hand on heart say I have never seen anyone handle a customer so badly as Mr S. He could win some kind of award for being unhelpful.

It is my perception that they simply do not care just how much distress they have caused me by this error and it is also my opinion that they have not gone above and beyond to put it right. They offered me a new test or a refund. I would not take a new test without a refund on top of it because I don’t trust them to do the second test either. After more arguing, they promised a refund without further contact. Refund received three days later so at least if you have issues, you should feel assured you can get your money back.

In the first he made it clear that my failure to absorb the posting information buried deep in the blood test leaflet and work out the conflict with the cortisol test was entirely my fault, and in no way due to the lack of clarity in said information, or the fact that nowhere on the listing did it explain that all blood tests must be posted Thursday latest or risk being invalidated.But Mr S really upped his game when I tried to contact Blue Horizon live chat when my cortisol test went missing. Despite being first in the queue I was just left hanging for ten minutes or so with no response to my initial query. So I opened up an incognito window in Chrome and went into chat under a different name and email address and surprise, surprise, Mr S replied immediately! He then tried to pretend he had just stopped dealing with another customer, which was odd, given I was the customer at the head of the queue. Not content with blatantly lying, he then proceeded be about as difficult as he could about a cortisol replacement kit, saying it would need 'investigating' (despite the fact Blue Horizon has clearly not received any results in the last week). About five minutes later, I wanted to ask something else, but every time I tried the chat window, it mysteriously disappeared. Spooky!I can hand on heart say I have never seen anyone handle a customer so badly as Mr S. He could win some kind of award for being unhelpful. It's a real shame, because other than that, Blue Horizon seemed good value and quite efficient.

I sent for a really important blood test and I was waiting on the edge of my seat for results because they would dictate how I adjust my medication. After over three weeks I found out they didn’t do the test due to lab error. I was furious and in tears. As a disabled person, it has cost me a lot of effort to get the blood drawn. On top of it, now I am left in limbo as I don’t know how to adjust my medication. I am absolutely livid that they failed to process my sample. I do not accept a technical error as an excuse. In the hundreds of blood tests I have had elsewhere, not one person has ever failed to process my sample. Based on other reviews on here, they seem to make an awful lot of errors. For this reason, I would never use them again. I could never in right conscience recommend them to anyone. I’ve had fiery arguments with them over email (I was the fiery one as I’ve been affected; to them this doesn’t matter as their lives haven’t been affected).  It is my perception that they simply do not care just how much distress they have caused me by this error and it is also my opinion that they have not gone above and beyond to put it right. They offered me a new test or a refund. I would not take a new test without a refund on top of it because I don’t trust them to do the second test either. After more arguing, they promised a refund without further contact. Refund received three days later so at least if you have issues, you should feel assured you can get your money back. I told them I will tell everyone about my bad experience and they implied a threat of legal action if I do so. See their reviews on here and elsewhere and be the judge.

During numerous communications I have had with the Boots Customer Care Team, I stipulated that I wanted NO telephone contact with the Shrewsbury Optician, (so what did the Shrewsbury Optician do - Yes - they telephoned me!). And as I thought they would do, tried to put the blame back on myself as having cancelled the eye appointment with them just before Christmas of last year. They really should be asking themselves why I cancelled that appointment, (I knew very well that there was something definitely very wrong with my eyes), by that time lost all confidence with Boots Optician Shrewsbury! As a result I booked an appointment with an independent opticians in Shrewsbury, who gave me very thorough eye tests and confirmed that the cataracts in my eyes were definitely not ""the start of them"" forming. I might add the new Optician referred me to Spa Medica for treatment for my left eye, since then I have had the pre-op assessment, and now have an appointment for the one cataract to be removed this month. I might further add that my two brothers who have also been customers at Boots Opticians Shrewsbury for years and like myself back to the days when it was D&A, (so none of us are new customers), will no longer be going to Boots either, this particular branch of Boots Optician has now lost three customers.Moral of the story - go to a independent optician.To say I am very angry about the whole episode would be an understatement. I found Boots Customercare helpful to start with but now appear to be almost impossible to contact by telephone and emails are just ignored! I shall be contacting Optical Complaints in due course as the varifocal glasses prescribed last October are only any use for reading in the one eye, and absolutely no use for distance! At a cost of £250.00 + for a pair of glasses with very limited use is something I simply cannot afford!\n            ', '\n                Great experience at Boots Liverpool Clayton Square today.

She could have just emailed me some details, but she actually took the time to call me & helped with a very unfortunate situation. Great service, thank you Rebecca (& team).In long;My (now) mother in-law & brother in-law flew into the UK for our wedding in early June. Multiple tests were required (day 2, day 5 early quarantine release, day 8, fit to fly), all purchased & delivered in great condition & in time.The day 2, 5 & 8 tests all went well, they were posted with Royal Mail in the packages we received alongside the tests & we received the results between 4 & 7pm the next day.However things took a turn for the worse when they were due to leave. As the flight was Tuesday evening & the fit to fly tests need to be taken a max of 72 hours before the flight, this was Saturday evening. No post office open on a Saturday at that time, or a Sunday in my area...So after contacting the airport to ask if they could take the test a few hours early, they advised it would not be accepted, it is 72 hours max. Messaged the Certific support team regarding flight times & the situation & they advised that so long as the parcel is received before 9am, they will keep an eye out for it and ensure we receive the results in time for their flight. Luckily I had purchased the express delivery option & had a parcel with 'guaranteed before 9am' postage already sorted.Off to the post office around 8am Monday morning, plenty of time to get the parcel out that day & delivered by 9am. When the parcel was delivered at 1130, we were obviously a bit concerned. I messaged Certific & they responded pretty quickly saying they had received the parcel in the building but didn't have it in the lab yet, but they will check & let me know.Not knowing if we would receive the results, they needed to be at the airport around 4pm, so we had to leave home around 2pm to get there on time, unless we heard something before.Halfway to the airport, finishing up in a service station in Somerset, walking back to the car, I received a call from Rebecca from the Certific support team. She had some bad news for me, they could not guarantee the results would be published in time for their flight...Obviously that news was not well received, but we had been thinking about that possibility since the day before so it did not come as a surprise. Rebecca (& her team) were very helpful by searching online & actually calling various health centers, clinics, Boots pharmacies & other places on route towards the airport to see if any of them had facilities to perform a same-day test. There were no's in all directions, nothing anywhere. Sold out or unavailable on short notice. They could not get through to one Boots pharmacy in a village close to me so we drove there & they were sold out. The in-laws were staying with me for longer.After that unfortunate adventure & Rebecca being great and supportive throughout the procedure, calling me back when I lost signal etc, the in-laws were staying until the next flight, which was Saturday.Rebecca arranged for new tests to be sent to me at no charge and with express return postage. Completed these tests and the in-laws returned home successfully (besides the plane being delayed & them having to sit on the plane for almost 3 hours before it took off! But that is a different story, a very bad one against Ryanair!)Rebecca could have just sent me an email saying they didn't receive the tests in time so they couldn't provide the results in time. I was expecting that and wouldn't have held it against them. But the effort and empathy shown really gave a fantastic customer experience in dealing with Certifc.\n            "", '\n                I used Certific for multiple travels because during COVID I had to travel for work reasons.

This caused a delay in our quarantine, but Sergio offered us a refund and the ability to use our day 8 test for our return flight test. I feel the company was overwhelmed initially, but they did offer excellent service in the end.\n            ', '\n                Our tests were organised by a friend for our return from Antigua. My parents who were staying at our house to look after the dog informed us that the tests had arrived and this was a good 3-4 days prior to us returning, so no delay whatsoever in getting the test kits. Initially, we were nervous about doing a video, however it was easy to follow once you downloaded the app and we got our test results back the following day, less than 24hrs later, so we were really pleased with the efficiency. However, Day 8 testing proved more tricky, this wasn’t an issue that Certific could have done much about we consequently found out and more to do with collections by Royal Mail from priority postboxes on a Sunday not proving to be a reality! Nevertheless, Certific bent over backwards to find out where our tests were, ensured our results would be back and we thus avoided another few days of isolation.

203,"['\n                This company is subcontracted to 1010Labs who are on the list of test providers provided by the UK Govt. As a resident of the Netherlands I decided to trust the UK Govt that the companies on the list would at least function at a basic level. I paid 2x £128.99 for my wife and I to have Day 2 and Day 8 PCR test kits delivered to our accommodation.How wrong we were.The only good thing was that the PCR test packs for Day 2 and Day 8 were waiting for us at our accommodation.We dutifully performed our tests for Day 2 and Day 8 and sent them off.The forms were very hard to fill in. The instructions did not completely match the forms. Nothing was pre-printed. There were several fields asking for barcodes and reference numbers but absolutely NO guidance on which number went where. I am sure we made a mistake or two as they were so ambiguous.We did NOT receive the results of our Day 2 tests.Upon enquiring via the telephone, the company stated that the tests had not been received. We checked with the post office and they could see that the delivery had taken place.By the time came for our Day 8 tests we were paranoid and angry. We videoed ourselves posting the test boxes into the priority post box and after receiving nothing by day 10 checked again with the post office (again recording the event) and they confirmed that the tests had again been delivered to the Lab in Manchester (again).Upon enquiring via telephone the staff at the lab (Circular 1 Health Ltd in Manchester) confirmed that the tests had been located and that mine was OK and that they would send a certificate. My wife\'s test however was not processed ""because she had somehow omitted her ethnicity"" (?what on earth this information is needed for I have no idea?). The staff member then asked a series of questions that made it sound like they were composing her record on line which included details that were not on the original form (!?). She refused to give any more information as it totally inappropriate what they were asking for.... surprisingly we both received negative certificates. However after that experience these were quite unbelievable. We are now back in NLD. Our trip was only to see our kids who we had not been able to see for a year. This was NOT a holiday. We will not however be planning to return to UK for some time after this experience as to me the whole country has turned into a load of paranoid chin-wobblers. We had to do the enforced 10 days of ""house arrest"" on arrival (and yes we were checked on by NHS test and trace EVERY day, sometimes twice a day). For me the whole COVID19 scare is being used to scam us. In total for the two of us, the entire cost of tests for the round trip was over GBP730 (combined cost of tests conducted in the NLD and UK).\n            ', '\n                I used this company through hhh diagnostic the did not answer call so many complaints there inbox is full never answers email Never gave me my 2 day test results\n            ']",,,

To which he answered 'no'.The test wasn't returned within 12 hours - no surprise - but to his credit, Zac did make sure he followed up with me that the test arrived.I wouldn't recommend that this company, as in my experience they do not seem to have their hands on the wheel, and the decision not to compensate me in any way for the error on behalf of the company, was unfair and unacceptable.I will be looking for a different provider for my covid test in the future.\n            "", '\n                They are very good aproching and quick customer service\n            ']",,,

I had breast augmentation and choosing Dr Nassab was the best decision i ever made. I couldn’t fault a single thing, from the consultation process, day of surgery and to the post op appointment.

I would recommend anyone thinking about a cosmetic procedure to make here their first choice.\n            ', '\n                Cosmetic Surgery is a costly procedure & should only be done for the right reasons. After many years I finally decided to go ahead with Breast Augmentation. Having researched on size, shape, placement including risks & complications I felt ready but needed to look for the right surgeon for the procedure. Am so pleased to have come across Mr Nassab. I instantly felt he was the right surgeon for me. My initial consultation was not rushed at all. He knew I was ready & listened to what kind of results I wished to achieve. He took measurements & showed different implants which I tried. I went away to think about the type of implant/size I wanted. I consulted his social media pages to see the results of clients with different implant sizes & placement. My emails were responded at the earliest convenience. I opted for a second consultation to finalise on size & decided to change the placement of the implant. Mr Nassab discussed my preference & assessed my suitability. I felt comfortable that he was confident with my choice. Post-Op Care was brilliant !!Day 3 - I felt something was not right & contacted CLNQ. He was not hesitant to see me the very same day. After this I felt reassured everything was ok & quite normal.Week 7 - My implants have healed well & settled nicely giving me a natural look & feel. My results are above my expectations. Am pleased to hear I am discharged knowing that I can contact him and his team at any point should there be a need. Thank you so much for everything.I wouldn’t have gone elsewhere.\n            ', '\n                Thank you so much! Ear love repair. My confidence is back.

The service I have received from my Initial phone call to my final appointment has been excellent Dr Nassab  and Katie so professional in every way. I am so pleased with the result. I would fully recommend CLNQ to everyone.  Many thanks to you both.\n            ']",,,
212,"['\n                Rude, incompetent and greedy doctor! Dr Bernadette gave me a prescription which the Harrods Pharmacy pharmacist and manager S. told me, was LEGALLY WRONG!!! The date was missing, her details were missing AND the second medication with that dosage doesn\'t even exist! I was told that the second medication is a sleeping pill and the pharmacist was very shocked that a doctor would mix that up! They asked me what kind of doctor Dr Bernadette is and I showed them her homepage. She said, that it\'s a very basic and popular sleeping pill and it\'s very weird, unprofessional and dangerous that someone who ""studied sleep medicine for 20 years"" isn\'t familiar with that kind of medication! The manager called Dr Bernadette\'s office and spoke to her assistent Nicola. Since she wasn\'t a scrap of help, we waited for a call back from Dr Bernadette. When she finally called the pharmacy, there was no apology, no remorse, nothing! Instead she even had the audacity to be rude to the pharmacy manager S. ! She told her that she wouldn\'t send a new prescriptions to the pharmacy and wouldn\'t even send a new (correct) prescription to me! When the manager asked her why she wouldn\'t do that, because it\'s her responsibility as a doctor to correct her mistakes, she just hung up! The manager looked shocked and literally said ""Wow, that was something... What is wrong with her?"" I regret that I chose this ""doctor"" that can\'t even write a correct prescription. Now, I don\'t even have my tablets and I\'m left without a solution for my sleeping problems, therefore I paid £300 for nothing!\n            ']",,,

You can't call anyone and the messages that I sent them this morning remain unanswered.  Considering this is a service that charges an exorbitant fee for doing absolutely nothing you would think that they would at least be available to answer any of their customers questions about the time sensitive sample and the very apecific time frames layed out by government.  I have had to contact the lab directly to get advice to ensure that our tests are done in time and so that we don't have to isolate, which would be catastrophic to both of us!!  Either answer your message quicker or get a calling service who can answer the calls for you if you are too busy to speak to your customers yourself.  Noone wants to do these tests let alone pay the ridiculous prices that we all now have to pay, the least you could do is be available to answer questions.  I must add, a day later I did see that there is a note on how to contact them, which is not one of the routes I tried.

I checked the tracking and they received our samples just after 2pm on Day 3, so I assume they counted it as received in the morning of Day 4. I am now in the afternoon of Day 5 and still no result. Don't use this service if you want to get out of quarantine quickly.We rebooked our Day 5 test with a provider that gives same day results.

I could have been out of the house yesterday with a negative result…They say “24h” but absolutely it does not match with reality!\n            ', '\n                Do not use this company. First of all, my kits arrived two days late. I sent in my Day 2 test as soon as I received it, but after five days I still never received results. I tried to get in touch with the company but they essentially ignored my WhatsApp messaged. They did, however, respond to a separate email simply telling me that the package never arrived. They\'re the ones who set up the package and presumably have the tracking info, but no more details were provided. Beyond these perfunctory responses they were not helpful whatsoever. When Day 8 came around I wondered if I should even send in my second test ... after all, what was the point? I\'m fully vaccinated and hadn\'t even been contacted by the NHS since arriving. This whole thing felt like a disorganized money grab. So I didn\'t send in the Day 8. And guess what: nothing happened. I found a place I could walk into to get a same day rapid PCR in order to fly out of the country. That worked fine. If you look into this company it\'s clear that it\'s a shady operation. Its ""office address"" is actually a front created by one of those shell companies you pay to set up a pseudo business address when you don\'t have a real office. It was also only incorporated a couple months ago, which is a bit of a red flag. I couldn\'t find any information on the person who apparently owns the company: Mr Nabil Sodfi. But the whole enterprise just seems sketchy. At best this is just a poorly run government-sanctioned grift.  I hope once the pandemic is over these pandemic profiteers, including the government goons who mandated this pointless and inefficient exercise, will be held to account.\n            ', '\n                Day 2 test arrived on time, did the test on a Friday morning, following the instructions, posted at lunchtime, results on Friday afternoon at normal Priority mail box, no drop off box needed. £65. Only thing to complain about was the cost! Everything else was fine.\n            ', ""\n                The only good thing I can say about this company, is that it does not take them too long to reply to your emails. Well, it also depends on what the email is about. I paid £190 for day 2, 5 (early release) and 8 tests. As soon as I ordered the tests, I got worried that I had been scammed, as I didn't get any confirmation email or receipt. I went on their website just to find an email and a WhatsApp number that says 'message only', which did not seem too professional to me at all. To give them some credit, they did reply quite fast, and sent me the confirmation with the Royal Mail tracking no. On their website, the company also promises that you get the results within 24 hours. In my case, on day 5 of my quarantine (Wednesday, late evening), I received the results for the test I had sent on day 3 (Monday, morning). This is more than 48 hours! Then, when I had concerns in regard to my early release day 5 test results  (I paid £60 for this one, as I had reasons to leave the house as soon as I could), I was told that the day 5 tests were prioritised and that I was going to get them as soon as possible. To put it in perspective, I sent my test on day 5 (Wednesday) early in the day, because it was 10am. When I contacted them the following day (Thursday), I was told that the tests hadn't arrived at the lab yet. Now I'm on day 7 of my quarantine, no email has come through and it seems like the company has been struggling to reply to all my previous emails, ever since I asked for a refund for (at least) my day 5 tests. I'll be leaving the quarantine in 3 days, so it really doesn't make sense for me to pay this amount of money for the test that doesn't do it's job. The issue here is that there is no law protecting the customers should they receive their test results later than they were meant to. And on top of that, there are so many people getting the tests, that you are not a customer the company needs to keep in order to survive. So basically, as soon as you pay, you're fu*ked.\n            "", '\n                Do not use. After paying almost £200 for test and release the tests did not arrive. I am in day 3 and this is causing significant problems.There was no confirmation email, you can only contact them by WhatsApp and they are insisting I gave them the wrong arrival dates, but no confirmation email to back up their claim.AVOID\n            ']",,,

However when I opened it, inside were no instructions - just a covid test and a crumpled envelope with an address in Bradford on to forward it too. I felt immediately that something was wrong.Looking for answers, I re-read the confirmation email, and worked out that I needed to register the test, although the email for the registration was in my junk email.I completed the test and had a strange feeling about the return envelope. Trusting my gut feeling that something was wrong, I decided to drive to Bradford and post it though the letterbox myself - a three hour round trip. This was after contacting their customer service department, and mentioning that I would like to drive to Bradford - yet this error was still missed.On arriving in Bradford at the address on the package, I was confused to arrive at some offices, where I was welcomed down some stairs into an office suite by a man named Zac.He told me he was sorry but there had been a mistake and I had been given an incorrect envelope - and no instructions in error. I started to panic that I had no left enough time now to get the test kit to the lab - which apparently was in Cambridge. Zac told me I he would send it off for me and I would have to results in 12 hours. Upset that I had had a near miss, and a wasted journey I asked Zac if he would compensate me in some way for my 3 hour round trip, petrol money and inconvenience. To which he answered 'no'.The test wasn't returned within 12 hours - no surprise - but to his credit, Zac did make sure he followed up with me that the test arrived.I wouldn't recommend that this company, as in my experience they do not seem to have their hands on the wheel, and the decision not to compensate me in any way for the error on behalf of the company, was unfair and unacceptable.I will be looking for a different provider for my covid test in the future.\n            "", '\n                They are very good aproching and quick customer service\n            ']",,,

In January this year I flew to London from USA, to see my brother who was between hospital admissions due to Pancreatic Cancer. I had no idea how to go about obtaining the necessary Covid tests for the required quarantine time in the UK. I went online and found a few sites where one could purchase the tests prior to leaving the States. DNA Workplace seemed to have the most professional feel and since I am a Nurse , I went with them ! I started to email via the ""contact\' information and had a lot of questions . I recall this was New Years eve and so I didn\'t expect an immediate response at all.  After a couple of e mails to Michael Brown (Customer service/logistics manager) I heard my phone ringing and it was Michael making a call to me to better explain the process. I was so impressed with his wonderful manner on the phone, clear explanation and patience with my many questions! (and that this was new years eve!)  I purchased the 5 day "" early release"" from Quarantine test and they also helped me organize a courier pick up , which I preferred to using the mail.I received my test results within 24 hours via e mail.DNA has a great way of teaching how to do the covid test with an online video presentation so that when the time comes to do the test (which they deliver to you the day before ) and record yourself online, the process is much easier. Also if you have any questions (which of course I did !) they are available on the phone to help anytime. I also like the way the billing is so streamline ; they will email the invoice for tests and or couriers and payment can be made securely via your phone.I then had another very positive experience in March. My brother was very sick so I flew in the manner of an emergency. I was able to purchase  the newly required day 2 and day 8 tests so as to land in the UK. I e mailed Michael and was able to also purchase the Day 5 release test along with courier assistance. Susie Williams (Snr account manager ) was also very helpful with my many questions.I was anxious to receive the Day five test as this would enable me to visit my brother who was now in Hospice ...I received the results the early the next morning and was so grateful.One more thing....DNA go above and beyond! Prior to leaving the UK several weeks later after my brother passed away, I purchased a new 12 hour ""turn around"" test for my ""Fit to fly"" back to USA. I received the test Friday and it was couriered back the same day.I was flying back Monday and on Saturday evening , Michael realized that the test had gone missing ! He e mailed me that he would be bringing another test to my home and driving it back himself....This was at least a two hour drive each way ! I received my results Sunday , again relieved and very Grateful to all at DNA and their excellent customer care and high degree of professionalism. I am sure to be using their services again this year. Thank you DNA.\n            ', '\n                I really think this company should not be on the government approved list.My day test 2 result didn`t arrive until the day 6 of my quarantine and it was positive. I have a doubt about the result. I booked Test to release appointment as I was worried my day 8 test result will not arrive in time as the first test was not received in the lab until Thursday (4 days after I have send it).The test to release was negative.I still had to extend my quarantine period which has caused me a lot of distress as I had job commitments. DNA workplace has cost me an extra £125 to go to waste as they delivered my results so late.They have everything covered in terms and conditions     as they say they are not responsible for delays caused by this or that. Very clever.There is no way I can prove the result was false but having in mind I had coronavirus in February/March and recovered. Also I had test done before my flight and it was obviously negative.So basically the result from DNA workplace is saying  within period of 10 days I was:Negative on day 1 (done in Czech republic)Positive on day 6 (done in UK, DNA workplace)Negative on day 11 (done in UK, Vivo clinic-Test to release)And again I must point out I had virus 1 month before all this.I will never book a test with this company again.\n            ', '\n                Excellent service received from DNATeam and they are very helpful with questions, courier etc... from beginning to the end during the self-quarantine.

I arrived back in the UK on the 27th of April 2021 from Thailand, my test arrived on the 28th, I recorded the video fine and completed the test. My friend posted it on the 28th and the results were back by the 30th. I have to say I was really worried about the situation after reading the reviews and I have to give a good review if I have had a good experience. So I will keep you updated with the 2nd test. I am hoping it goes just as well. Let's see. Thank you DNA workplace, so far I am pleased. So don't let me down and I will update this to a 5 star. So up-date on the delivery of the 2nd test, it was late but also a bank holiday so eventually, they had it couriered to me in the end and called me to make sure it had arrived. In all honesty, if you are not in such a rush for everything you will be able to use this company, no problem. I had a personal call and I believe that they honestly and truthfully did a good job for me personally.

I received both my tests on the correct day. Both took more than 24 hours before the returns were acknowledged by DNA Workplace... I then received my results within 24 hours. As a result, I got my final result at 18:13 on my last day of quarantine.Every step was accompanied by a confirmation email. It was not immediately obvious to me where/how to find the instructional video and the upload link... this was only given in the dispatch email, and not in the printed documentation or on their website.

I had arranged this with the clinic supervisor, who had been very helpful. The receptionists at the clinic were also very helpful and we have no complaint at all against them. The medical was being carried out in order to apply for a Saudi Arabian visa and cost £357. We were promised that the results would be emailed to us on Tuesday 17th of August and then a hard copy posted onto us.  This seemed like quite a long time but we accepted it.No email was received on Tuesday 17th August as promised. Nothing was received on the 18th or 19th of August either. On the 20th of August my wife received a phone call from the Harley Street clinic informing her that the results would not be ready until August 30th. This is not the service that we paid for and we would have definitely avoided Doctor Call and will certainly never use them again. That was the first and last time. The delay is causing problems for me as my employer are waiting for the medical results and this is holding up the whole process.There is a risk that she will have to restart the visa application.

There was no queue for the walk-in (Tuesday morning) and maybe a four-car one for the drive-through. The ID check (passport) took 20 seconds. The young man taking the sample - pharyngeal & nasal - was practiced and professional, it also took maybe 30 seconds; I've had far worse, and I've done the test around a dozen times in Tokyo, London, Dubai, at home etc. The test result arrived at 19:43 the next day, well before the 22:00 promised, and my departure from Heathrow the day after. All round I can highly recommend this service.P.S. It took four hours to clear the various hurdles - and another test, albeit free - at Haneda International Airport.

The instructions to take the test are not clear either and I actually didn't realise there was a bag to send it back in as wasn't mentioned (but found it in the packaging later) so lucky it got there in one piece!Also they were quite vague about when to expect the results (and what they told me totally contradicted what the courier said) which when it is for 5 day test to release is very frustrating!Might have only given 3 stars for those reasons but being able to contact them made all the difference.\n            "", '\n                Excellent and very helpfull customer service\n            ', ""\n                My test was easy and negative which was welcome but my wife's test was inconclusive.

If you have given them your money, I have advice for you. They are a fine example of the parasitic ""medical companies"" that sprouted up following the government\'s decision in December 2019 to deregulate COVID test providers. This company is run as a ""side job"" for its owners. They are uninterested in consumer protection laws, COVID testing or handling of biological samples. My experience with them. I booked the mandatory Day 2 and Day 8 test kits. Cost: £175Test kit for Day 8 was missing the ""95 kPa specimen transport bag"" and absorbent material. This leak proof packaging is a legal requirement under the UN 3373 regulations for transport of biological samples (Category B goods).I told them and they attempted to dodge responsibility by claiming that ""the lab"" sent them the kits incomplete. They suggested that I send the samples without the correct leakproof packaging. I explained that this is unsafe and probably illegal. Their response? To ""use a sealable bag of some sort similar to the common sandwich bag."" I have reported them to: UKAS Public Health England Norfolk County Council Trading Standards If they have sent you incomplete test kits you have a right to a refund. Goods that are not ""fit for purpose"" must be refunded under The Consumer Rights Act 2015, part one, chapter two, section ten.  I requested a refund under these terms on 24th March. Incredibly, they asked me for ""evidence"" that I had to book a Day 8 test with an alternative provider. I obliged them on 1st April.1 April: no reply. Email resent.2 April: no reply. Email resent.5 April: no reply. Email resent. 6 April: I rang the company and spoke to someone (no manager present). Later that day I was sent an email telling me that I was lucky enough to be getting a ""half refund""... which turned out to be only 43%. Not good enough. I have made a court claim against them (9 April). I will be seeing them at the County Court soon enough for a full refund with interest plus costs.

Please note that my wife and I are not associated with this company.1) We paid and booked 2nd Day test, and we promptly received booking confirmations with booking reference numbers, which then allowed us to enter reference number into our passenger locator forms.2) Another emails from DPD courier followed promptly, providing date and time the test kits will be delivered to us.3) Test kits were delivered by DPD, exactly as scheduled, on another day from the date we booked and paid for the test.4) We received additional emails titled: ""Kit activation and tracking information"". Unfortunately, the both emails were missing test kit bar codes and activation PINs.(This is the only reason we take one star off our review.) 5) Concerned about the fact that we were not provided with activation PINs for our test kits, before 9.00 AM I first emailed: a)info at livecovidtesting.co.uk, b)results at livecovidtesting.co.uk, c)dispatching at livecovidtesting.co.uk- as their landline phone number: 03302235697 is active from Monday to Friday: 09:00-18:00, and mobile phone number 07874074688 (provided on the Trustpilot contact details) is not valid for this type of enquiry anymore.6) On the same day, two minutes past nine in the morning, I decided to give the company a call on 03302235697. The call was answered in reasonable time (there were already 5 persons in the queue), in polite, fast and professional manner, and we received our activation PIN over the phone. The entire phone call (including the waiting time) lasted 13 minutes.7) A half an hour after my phone call, I also received polite and professional email responses to my enquiry from:a)info at livecovidtesting.co.uk, b)results at livecovidtesting.co.ukTo summarise our experience with this company, the only reason we cannot rate it 5 stars is the fact that the activation PIN for our test kits were missing from dedicated for this purpose emails, and therefore we had to enquire it (without any problems) directly from the customer service. Considering that nothing is perfect, the company did quite well for us, which can be a positive sign of serious improvement (bearing in mind the existing number of really bad, one star reviews on Trustpilot).\n            ', '\n                Convenient location in Norwich.

Third time using Local PCR, every time gets a little quicker and easier.\n            ', '\n                I booked the full 4 tests (pre-flight, 2 and 8 and day 5 to release) through this company and my son also booked the day 2 and 8.  So my pre-flight was rejected and I had to pay to have a 4 hour turn around quick test at the airport, my 2 worked and I got the (negative) results within 24 hrs - my son who had his 2 day test one hour later than me at the same centre, is still waiting on the results some 96 hours after the test (chased twice and sounds like they lost it but they have not confessed yet).   I tried to ask them to amend my Day 8 test, as I will be in Dorset and they offered me a slot in Birmingham (7 hr+ round journey) - so I asked if they could provide a postal day 8 test and that was a No since the post is apparently unreliable (it seems fine for Boots) - so I asked for a refund so I could book elsewhere and the answer was NO despite admitting that they would use the test for other people.   Poor service, manager with no power and no idea what they are doing.  I would suggest avoiding this company if you want to ensure you get the tests on time and or wish to enjoy any customer service.   PS the bit that did work was the actual test and the good people giving it\n            ', '\n                I needed to book a pcr test with results in 72 hours of flying to Jersey. I found a number for my local pcr testing site and was lucky enough to speak to a lady called Michaela, she was the most friendly and helpful person ever and found out all the extra information I may require for my destination. She booked my appointments on the phone and gave me the I formation I required before having the test, she has calmed my nerves of getting the correct test, look forward to having it done on Monday.\n            ', '\n                Great and professional customer service, Mo was very informative and talked me through the process step-by-step.

I would 100% recommend.\n            ', '\n                Booked day 2 and 8 test with this company as their website said results by 7pm. I even have an email from them confirming the appointment and the email very clearly states results back by 7pm.At the appointment we were informed that it would be results by 7pm the next day and not the same day. Called the company when we got home and was informed by Michaela that it would never have been received on the same day by 7pm and that is an error on the email and on their website. According to her results take 24-36 hours to come back as they have to be sent to a govt lab and localpcr has no control over when those results will come back.What a total scam! Didn’t need to pay £210 for a test expecting results same day per their website and could have picked a cheaper company which was transparent about it taking 24-36 hours. I will be reporting this company to consumer standards for false advertising. Shame on you for taking advantage of people during a pandemic!\n            ', '\n                Michaela was so lovely and so helpful on Thursday, couldn’t have asked for nicer service, made the experience so much easier!

Called ""Customer Service"" and was told they are still waiting reciept of the results themselves??Escalated the issue to the manager later in the day who was just as unhelpful.

Steve (or whatever hes real name is) confirmed they are not allowed to call the lab only to email them - even though after speaking with a Manager he was able to call them?? Manager (Vik) said that as its a Saturday, it could be that they have less staff/skeleton staff on weekends hence the delays - As a consumer who has paid appoximately £185.00, its not really our problem or concern if they have staffing issues. Its the test centres responsibilities to liaise with the lab centre and ensure all customer results meet their deadline as they promise on their website.Basically, this is just a front facing outfit which takes your money and then denies all responsibility for the lab testing and the timeline for the results.Customer Service was below poor. Management took no responsibility for the service and was too concerned with giving political answers.Asked they get someone else of management in the company to call me who can give direct answers to the experience ive encountered and they refused and requested I email so I waste more of my time for the same answer.Mis-sold a product and took no responsibility or offered any compensation or part reimbursement for the utter crap service.

I was misdiagnosed with a brain bleed (which of course terrified me), so I spent nearly a grand seeing multiple specialists to confirm I was okay. I was told this was a misdiagnosis, but the absolute devastating trauma this has caused me during this time is hard to put into words. I contacted the company and demanded atleast a refund (as this would not even cover my costs due to the misdiagnosis) and of course they are stringing me along for weeks with no real intention of rectifying their mistake. AVOID. Pay more and go to a centre with better radiologists. I will pursue legal action to be appropriately compensated.Side note, I was sent an informal email with terrible grammar as a ""diagnosis"" for my scan.

Go elsewhere.\n            ', '\n                I\'ve been referred to LycaHealth at Canary Wharf by my GP for a couple of tests and a consultation. Luckily enough, my corporate insurance scheme covered the costs because frankly - I don\'t see why people should pay a penny for this kind of services. In just one week\'s time their team managed to screw things up exactly three times. 1) They booked me for an ultrasound scan with a wrong specialist. I can\'t even start to understand how this is possible in the first place but I asked my manager for a few hours off to be able to attend. Then they called me with the news that my appointment is not available.2) The guy who called me (he knows who he is, I can pass this info directly to the management) wasn\'t even one bit apologetic about the situation. Let\'s say, the whole attitude there is somewhere along the lines of ""if you have issues with us, then just leave"". The call was disconnected at some point and guess what? They never called me back! I waited for 3 hours before calling them myself, got the same guy back on the phone, told him that a normal service provider would actually call his client back - zero reaction but he\'s probably too fancy shmancy to bother, I\'ll give him that. My appointment was rescheduled - but it\'s also plain weird how they are not able to accomodate the needs of people working office hours in these times (zero flexibility in booking times and low overall availability).3) Now we\'ve come to the best bit! The final follow-up I\'ve been waiting for. Got my line manager to split my shift, so I could go and see the doctor face to face (the doctor is amazing, btw), got on the train, got off at Canary Wharf and yes, you guessed it. No appointment. Just as I was getting off the train, my doctor called me with a million of apologies (for smth that wasn\'t even his fault) because the booking team managed to book him an appointment with me at the wrong time. I had to turn back and go home and we did the initial appointment over the phone. Wow. So, the summary is this: I wasted my time and my money to come to the clinic for nothing. Who\'s gonna compensate me for that? Also, I made a very pointless and unnecessary journey in the lockdown - was that a responsible thing to do? Did the staff call me to reschedule? No, they didn\'t. I got a call from my doctor who is (thankfully) a decent person and bothered to handle this situation while the staff out there were sitting in a nicely furnished room doing whatever it is they are doing every day.I genuinely feel sorry for all the amazing specialists who have to work in such an environment.

As Lyca Canary Wharf is the only one nearby I went there on tuesday. Unfortunately, the images of the X-Ray showed my foot has a fracture that might require surgery. Lyca’s team said the report from the radiologist could take up to 48 hours. On friday I called and the receptionist told me that the report was not ready, I asked why and how could not be ready if they assured it could take up to 48 hours and 48 hours have passed?, the receptionist responded that the radiologist called off-sick so the report will be ready for monday.

I’m a resident of France. This wasn’t a holiday and I was bound by time and money constraints. There wasn’t time to order a home kit so I had no choice but to find somewhere local. Firstly the Mayfield online booking system didn’t work well and I spent a few anxious moments thinking I’d paid twice for two appointments. However, thankfully this wasn’t the case. I received an invoice and a confirmation email so all good.For the appointment itself, I arrived on time and was told to wait. Imagine my surprise to find I was in a doctor’s surgery with around 15 other people! Some were coughing, there wasn’t any ventilation. It was horrible! I told the receptionist that my appointment was at 2.15 and the first thing she said was that it was 2.20 but I’d have to wait like everyone else! I had paid 249 pounds for a service that was essentially in an NHS surgery! I went back to complain and show her confirmation of my appointment time and eventually the doctor came out. The swab went very well. The doctor was lovely. He explained that his surgery didn’t get a penny of the 249 pounds. It all goes to Mayfield clinic. As for the results, I hadn’t realised that I needed to register the barcode myself. Again, you’d think for a premium service, they would take care of that for you. The doctor hadn’t explained. Yes he gave me papers but I had to then take my mother to her doctor’s appointment so left without understanding this. I was more anxious to get my mother to her appointment on time, as my appointment had been late. To be fair, only by 10 minutes but still, for a premium service, this is unacceptable. When the results didn’t arrive the next day, I panicked! I had no other way of contacting Mayfield clinic other than via email. To be fair, they responded very quickly. I was able to register and the (negative) results arrived very quickly. I wouldn’t use this company again though. Firstly, I didn’t get the premium service I paid for and at 249 pounds, this is expected. I also don’t feel secure using a company that just has email contact. You have to be a member to be able to speak to someone. Also, it’s not ideal having the test done in an NHS surgery with everyone else. The idea is to be FIT to fly, not to catch Covid. These private test companies have been set up to ease pressure off the NHS so we can’t blame them for cashing in on the situation.

I haven't seen anyone else charge as much as these guys. At one point they were charging nearly £300 for a same day pcr test. It's obvious they are in the health busines purely to make money.

These test kits cost pennys to purchase, yet they are then sold on for hundreds of pounds. My sons day 2/8 test kit took over a week to arrive, we even had the bogus DPD delivery driver who lied and said he had attempted delivery. Unfortunately caught out because of the CCTV camera and the dog and the fact that my son who was in quarantine was funnily enough at home. The kit then arrived damaged - completely bent. He then took his day 2 test on day 4 and we received results on day 8. Goodness knows when we will get day 8 test results. Everyone is blaming the postal system but I just don't buy this - its a convenient excuse. I should add my other son who is at one of the boarding schools in the Midlands had an atrocious experience too, results being chased multiple times and test and release really proving useless to even take. When one asks for a refund we are told its just not possible. Why? Why is it not possible? This is capitalism at its very worst - or should I say best.

My only feedback is that the in-clinic test is rather expensive (£215) and there are now more competitive prices from alternative providers.My in-home test experience was also very positive, I recently booked the day 2 & 8 home tests. I had an issue with my online payment which was sorted very quickly by their customer service, Rosie answered all my questions and was very helpful! The day 2 result arrived slightly delayed (on my quarantine day 5) but I believe this was for Royal Mail postage reasons (I posted my test on Sunday and despite the post box was listed online as a priority one, there was a notice saying they wouldn’t take any post that day - so I suspect my results didn’t arrive to the lab until Tuesday, my quarantine day 4, which means the lab did their job very quickly).

In the months following their inadequate and incompetent efforts, I have pursued a refund via a chargeback on our debit cards. Although Nowtest challenged the chargeback, our claims have ultimately been successful as their challenge was as inadequate and incompetent as their “service”. They set a marker for their inadequacy by heading the challenge document as “compelling evidence for the chargeback”. In truth all the evidence was indeed for the chargeback, and it was, certainly, compelling. However, I think they probably intended to make a case against, rather than for, the chargeback.I would encourage all dissatisfied customers to raise a claim via debit or credit card companies.  Nowtest defend their position by quoting selectively from their terms and conditions. Unfortunately for them the claims made by such selective quotes are demolished by the full text and context. The terms and conditions are nonsense anyway, as they refer constantly to an “app” – and the Nowtest interface is clearly not an app but an interactive website. References to Apple and Google app store terms and conditions clearly show that Nowtest’s t&c are for an entirely different, and probably imaginary, product.Key elements that customers might use to support a refund are that Nowtest say they will inform you of delays beyond their control, and that if they do so they will not be responsible for those delays. Given that they don’t appear to inform customers at all, they must therefore be responsible for delays beyond their control. It goes without saying that delays within their control are their responsibility. So, if you didn’t hear from them (no response to emails, telephone calls etc) they cannot avoid responsibility.Nowtest also make much of not guaranteeing turnaround times and delivery. This can’t stretch beyond a reasonable delay. Nobody could suggest that a delay of weeks was acceptable – not even Nowtest, I imagine. Their lack of guarantee wouldn’t stretch that far. A day’s delay might be acceptable, but delays extending beyond the quarantine time clearly render the service unfit for purpose.In our case, the height of absurdity was Nowtest’s contention that if we had committed a crime they would not be responsible for refunding our money. They didn’t actually say that we had committed a crime – that would have been libellous, as we hadn’t – but for some inexplicable and unsupportable reason they introduced this suggestion as a potential justification for denying a refund.It is obvious from the reviews here that this company should be avoided by all. If, like me, you were misled by the idea that their appearance on a government site was some indication of quality and you paid them for an inadequate service, then fight for a refund. They may well refuse – but fight via your credit or debit provider if that is how you paid. It is hard work – Nowtest put up a 22 page document to defend against our claims – but they lost.  It took many hours of effort on our part to explore the misleading, inaccurate and false statements they made to deny our refunds, but I believed it necessary to try to limit their assault on normal standards of trade.Note to Nowtest: If you are tempted to comment, as you do in so many cases, “We are sorry that your experience was not to the level you were expecting” there is no need. This review relates to your actions after the failure to supply and process tests. It applies to the period when you did live up to our expectations by being just as incompetent and inadequate as we thought you would be.\n            ', ""\n                Absolutely awful company.

She didn’t even apologise for the inconvenience, made it sound like a problem to her instead! Also she doesn’t make the clients aware of the wait time, they had to ask after a while themselves, she really is a horrible receptionist! This poor lady who needed to see a doctor waited for a long time and then couldn’t understand what she was saying cause she was speaking so fast! I cannot believe she has a job in there, super unwelcoming and just uncomfortable person! Not British but speaks English super fast like she is in some kind of race or was trying to prove something, she had a bad accent so she should speak slowly especially to elderly vulnerable people. She spoke differently to the doctors and people working there who were constantly coming to the reception. She was so warm and welcoming to them but absolutely horrible to the clients. Such a fake person! I am 33 years old but look like I am 20 or less and so does my friend, she just disrespected us probably based on that! She cannot find any names, another woman went through the same crap had to show emails etc and when the other receptionist came she was like “her name is right there”! When my friends time came she said “mr ...go to the 3rd floor”, there was another guy the man who’s name she couldn’t “find” on her spreadsheet and she said “excuse me and you can go too” what was that?! Not only he has a name but she could at least get up from her ass and walk to him instead of shouting as he sat far away!Do you ever check your cameras to see how your staff treats your customers? I was just about to sign in with your as a regular client as I am currently searching for a new private clinic but hell no. After everything I have witnessed, there is no way I would sign up even if the doctors were good, the staff is definitely disrespectful and full of themselves.

He also confirmed the location of our nearest drop box for our Day 2 test, which was useful.\n            ', '\n                fast ,efficient and friendly from megan hegarty\n            ', '\n                Good afternoon,I would like to make a complaint regarding numerous issues with your service which have caused me deep distress and inconvenience.I booked my \'Day 2 test\' in the early hours of 26th August 2021 as I had a flight scheduled for 17:25 of the same day. I was not permitted to board the plane, only because the reference number for the \'UK Locator form\' that I was given from your customer service team was incorrect. I initially tried to enter the reference number (screenshot of email enclosed) from the confirmation email: ""RANDX2103481"" but was unsuccessful as it displayed: ""error"" ""invalid URN"". So I contacted your customer service department by email who then sent me another reference number (screenshot of email enclosed) to use at 12:00 on 26th August: ""RTCS - 108691"". However the same error messages displayed on the locator form. I then sent two further emails at 12:05 and 15:06 that day asking for help with a screenshot enclosed demonstrating that the reference number did not work, but have yet to receive any replies. So based on this, I wasn\'t able to board the flight and became quite distressed, as you could imagine. I did and paid for all of the relevant testing and everything else necessary to fly but was not able to, through no fault of my own.I managed to book another flight with another airline the next morning, 27th August and by this time I was able to enter the original reference number correctly, as I had to ask my mother to call your customer service department, where someone must have done something because the original code had not worked earlier. Unfortunately by then it was too late! When I went to your testing site on arrival at the airport and explained the situation, they told me that they didn\'t ""deal with"" those issues there and that my test would arrive at my address. It is now Friday 3rd September and I am still waiting for the ""Day 2 test"" to arrive. I have called your customer service line numerous times, namely on 30th August when one of your advisers said that it may arrive on Tuesday or Wednesday but ""wasn\'t sure"". Having placed other numerous calls (many due to being hung up on despite being cordial and patient) to you customer service and DTD (who have said that they haven\'t received the parcel), I finally received an email from Abigail Fleming yesterday afternoon asking me if I would like the test to be re-sent or a refund - with no apology nor admission that it has been lost. If I choose a refund, would I still be able to return to Spain not having done your \'day 2\' test? I am worried and stressed about this as I was under the impression that the test had to be carried out within two days of arrival. I do not want to be arrested by police nor denied re-entry to Spain. I am further distressed as I have been in self isolation for 7 days now and the whole reason for my visit here is to spend time with my Grandmother who is terminally ill with cancer. I have been unable to visit her or do anything else.I would like to receive a full refund of the test \'£48.00\' and/or the cost of my original Ryanair flight from Barcelona to Belfast which cost \'€22.99\'. I would also like to receive compensation for the extra flight which I had to pay \'€52.99\' due to the inaccurate information given to me by your ""Travel Centre Support"", as well as any other compensation you deem appropriate, as a result of the distress and inconvenience experienced on my part.If you need any other evidence or information, don\'t hesitate to contact me.Please confirm receipt of this email.Thank you for reading it and considering my request.Yours sincerely,Mark Rice\n            ', '\n                Excellent service, very fast result (1hr 30mins) from express service.

569,"['\n                Marc Mitchell was very helpful when I needed information regarding URN and booking reference numbers. He also confirmed the location of our nearest drop box for our Day 2 test, which was useful.\n            ', '\n                fast ,efficient and friendly from megan hegarty\n            ', '\n                Good afternoon,I would like to make a complaint regarding numerous issues with your service which have caused me deep distress and inconvenience.I booked my \'Day 2 test\' in the early hours of 26th August 2021 as I had a flight scheduled for 17:25 of the same day. I was not permitted to board the plane, only because the reference number for the \'UK Locator form\' that I was given from your customer service team was incorrect. I initially tried to enter the reference number (screenshot of email enclosed) from the confirmation email: ""RANDX2103481"" but was unsuccessful as it displayed: ""error"" ""invalid URN"". So I contacted your customer service department by email who then sent me another reference number (screenshot of email enclosed) to use at 12:00 on 26th August: ""RTCS - 108691"". However the same error messages displayed on the locator form. I then sent two further emails at 12:05 and 15:06 that day asking for help with a screenshot enclosed demonstrating that the reference number did not work, but have yet to receive any replies. So based on this, I wasn\'t able to board the flight and became quite distressed, as you could imagine. I did and paid for all of the relevant testing and everything else necessary to fly but was not able to, through no fault of my own.I managed to book another flight with another airline the next morning, 27th August and by this time I was able to enter the original reference number correctly, as I had to ask my mother to call your customer service department, where someone must have done something because the original code had not worked earlier. Unfortunately by then it was too late! When I went to your testing site on arrival at the airport and explained the situation, they told me that they didn\'t ""deal with"" those issues there and that my test would arrive at my address. It is now Friday 3rd September and I am still waiting for the ""Day 2 test"" to arrive. I have called your customer service line numerous times, namely on 30th August when one of your advisers said that it may arrive on Tuesday or Wednesday but ""wasn\'t sure"". Having placed other numerous calls (many due to being hung up on despite being cordial and patient) to you customer service and DTD (who have said that they haven\'t received the parcel), I finally received an email from Abigail Fleming yesterday afternoon asking me if I would like the test to be re-sent or a refund - with no apology nor admission that it has been lost. If I choose a refund, would I still be able to return to Spain not having done your \'day 2\' test? I am worried and stressed about this as I was under the impression that the test had to be carried out within two days of arrival. I do not want to be arrested by police nor denied re-entry to Spain. I am further distressed as I have been in self isolation for 7 days now and the whole reason for my visit here is to spend time with my Grandmother who is terminally ill with cancer. I have been unable to visit her or do anything else.I would like to receive a full refund of the test \'£48.00\' and/or the cost of my original Ryanair flight from Barcelona to Belfast which cost \'€22.99\'. I would also like to receive compensation for the extra flight which I had to pay \'€52.99\' due to the inaccurate information given to me by your ""Travel Centre Support"", as well as any other compensation you deem appropriate, as a result of the distress and inconvenience experienced on my part.If you need any other evidence or information, don\'t hesitate to contact me.Please confirm receipt of this email.Thank you for reading it and considering my request.Yours sincerely,Mark Rice\n            ', '\n                Excellent service, very fast result (1hr 30mins) from express service.
